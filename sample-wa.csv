Albany Primary School,5002,"

Our school is a learning community that highly values life-long learning and facilitates excellence in student achievement. Our practices focus on enabling students to demonstrate our motto 'Strive to Achieve'.

Albany Primary School staff are an experienced, dedicated group who are working effectively together to enhance the performance of all students and to manage and improve school facilities.

Staff members include those that maintain and clean the facility, manage reception and finance, support the educational program, conduct the educational program and manage the school as administrators.

We are pleased that we have developed a very strong, positive and beneficial partnership between staff, parents and approximately 500 students from Kindergarten to Year 6.

Over the past five years the school has worked towards developing, implementing and then embedding an evidence-based Literacy Program for all students. This program features a focus on guided reading, phonics, spelling and writing.

In the Early Childhood area of the school, staff continue to focus on all key aspects of a child's development. This includes physical, cognitive, social, creative and personal development. The staff have worked jointly to raise literacy expectations whilst still providing opportunities to learn through hands on processes and structured, purposeful play.

The school has been able to develop an excellent set of technology resources that are used widely in classrooms. Students can access learning programs through PCs, iPads, notebooks and interactive whiteboards. The school also has a dedicated computer lab and PCs in the library to use for research work.

The school has four specialist areas that are conducted by specialist teachers. All students from Years 1 to 6 participate in science, music and physical education on a weekly basis. Indonesian is currently provided to Year 3 students and will be offered to all students in Years 3 to 6 by 2021.

Our students' passion for music is further developed through the provision of programs by the School of Instrumental Music. Selected students have the opportunity to develop their skills in playing instruments such as trumpet, double bass, cello, flute, clarinet, viola, violin and guitar.

Albany Primary School is currently transitioning to becoming a Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) school. We look forward to sharing more information about this throughout 2018.

Our school is relatively new and therefore has facilities that include a music room, dedicated science room, a dedicated computer lab, an art room, a spacious purpose built library, a well-resourced assembly area set up for performing arts and a dedicated early childhood facility as well as classrooms and various supporting storage space.

The grounds are spacious and structured to accommodate opportunities for students to engage in various sports and play. Over the years the P & C and school have worked together to enhance the facilities and aesthetics of the grounds. This has ensured that the school has a stimulating early childhood play area, an adventure playground for the primary aged students and sporting fields dedicated to winter and summer sports.

Our Purpose
Albany Secondary Education Support Centre (ASESC) is committed to providing a safe, caring and supportive environment where students are empowered to achieve their social, emotional and academic potential. We promote and maintain positive relationships both within our school community and with the larger community. We foster an inclusive environment that provides opportunities for all students to develop independence for life and actively contribute to society.

Our school aims for excellence in all areas and to be a leader for Western Australia in Education Support.

Our Values
Respect and Responsibility, Excellence and Equity, Care and Commitment

ASESC caters for students with a mild to moderate intellectual disability from Years 7-13. All of our students are at educational risk with all requiring substantial or extensive adjustments to the teaching and learning program as well as the learning environment. As the only secondary education support centre in the region we attract students from as far afield as Kojonup and Jerramungup with many students travelling by bus from Denmark and Mount Barker.

ASESC is an Independent Public school and therefore enjoys greater flexibilities which enable us to be more proactive and responsive to student need, in particular with reference to our staffing profile, resources and facilities. We maintain a 1:1 iPad to student ratio, a school van and a school bus to support student community access and participation.

ASESC is a Positive Behaviour School. We explicitly teach our students the skills they need to be Safe, Responsible, Respectful, Positive and Caring. We recognise and reward effort and achievement and promote positive relationships for all members of our school community. Every student at ASESC has an Individual Education Plan which is tailored to their specific individual needs.

An important focus at ASESC is increasing student independence and ability to actively engage with and contribute to their community. ASESC is an ASDAN school which enables us to deliver an accredited program that makes learning relevant and transferable; develops skills for learning, skills for employment and skills for life and celebrates the diversity of our students. We enhance the learning experience with programs such as Community Work Crew, Workplace Learning and Bush Rangers which all assist our students in developing their skills for independence, gaining recognition for their achievements and preparing for the world beyond school.

At ASESC we believe communication represents an essential and very important human need and improving communication skills is a focus for all students. We have a multi modal approach to communication, which incorporates alternative augmentative communication systems such as Proloquo2go and PECS (Picture Exchange Communication Systems) as well as PODDS (Pragmatic Organisation Dynamic Display), to assist students with communication challenges. One particularly distinctive feature of ASESC is our HALO (or Rapid Prompting Method) program which is designed to support the learning needs of students with autism and communication challenges.

At Alkimos Primary School our priorities are to create:
A Alkimos Learning Community. This includes: students as learners, teachers as learners and parents as learners, and a Alkimos Healthy Community. This includes: student health and wellbeing, staff health and wellbeing and family health and wellbeing.

Our approaches to teaching and learning are that our staff understand that the quality of your relationships with students is the key. Our teachers are able to adeptly engage families and the Alkimos school community, as crucial to our school's success is the extent to which this sense of belonging and connectedness can be created.

A commitment to implementing whole-school curriculum policies and programs will be evident, demonstrating all teachers' capacity to be attuned to the individual needs of students, and their authentic skill to provide an inclusive, fair and safe classroom.

Underpinning our approaches is a clear recognition that students' learning outcomes and opportunities are maximised when robust non-academic strategies and beliefs are apparent.

Allanson Primary School,5006,"

Allanson Primary School has a long and colourful history and tradition as documented by Aileen Rusconi and Esther Saunders in the Publication, 'Our Little Bush School.'
The original Allanson School was established in 1913 to cater for children from families involved in the first coal mining and timber felling operations in this region. Dorothy Gibson was our school's founding principal and she opened the rolls with 27 students.

The original 1913 building was extensively renovated during 2001. This restoration project was undertaken by members of the Allanson community and funded through a Centenary of Federation grant. The building has returned to its former glory and stands proudly in the school playground.

Student numbers steadily increased throughout the years requiring the construction in 1923 of Allanson's second school building. This was extended in 1926 to its current size. It is presently used as a Kindergarten, Music/Drama room and by a local playgroup.

In 1990 the third school building consisting of a cluster of four classrooms, utility area, toilets, breezeway and administration area was completed. These additions to the school catered for the increased student population following the release of land in the Allanson Park subdivision.

An administration upgrade completed for the commencement of the 2002 school year included a new office, reception, sick bay, storage room, staff room and improvements to staff toilets and work area. An extension to the breezeway and the inclusion within the design of external doors has dramatically improved the available facilities for students. A new boy's toilet and changes to the girl's toilet allows students external access.

Extensions to the lawn area for use during lunch and recess time is an additional improvement impacting on the safe management of student traffic.

Allanson has always been a small school and was threatened with closure in 1984 as enrolments had fallen to approximately 8 students. Since 1986 through the support of the community, Allanson Primary School has experienced steady growth. This has seen the school grow from a 'small bush school' to a level 4 school in less than 12 years. From 1997 the school has catered for the education of primary students from the age of 4 (K) to the age of 12 (Yr 7). The school library is housed in a transportable building (1997) however through the use of technology research work is coordinated throughout the school.

In May 2000 a purpose built transportable Early Childhood Centre was located alongside the 'old' school and joined via a verandah. The Pre-Primary students are located in this transportable room.

A new library resource/technology centre is planned for completion in April 2006. The library will be inclusive of the school ICT program and continue the strong ICT influence clearly evident across all classrooms and the way in which teachers teach and students learn.

Allanson Primary School is best described as having 'a learning environment' where students are able to achieve at their optimum level and maximise learning opportunities.

In 2103, Allanson celebrated its centenary year.

VISION
Allanson Primary School is to be:
A small community enriched school that provides a high standard of educational opportunities across all learning areas, identifying and catering for the talents and needs of individual students to prepare them for the ever changing future.

MISSION STATEMENT
To ensure that our students develop the understandings, skills and attitudes relevant to individual needs thereby enabling them to fulfill their potential and contribute to the development of our society.

SCHOL MOTTO: CARE LEARN ACHIEVE
How we want our students to use their school motto to help guide their way at Allanson PS.

Care: Respect and concern for ourselves, respect and concern for others and care for the environment

Learn: Strive to be a responsible learner to gain essential skills, knowledge and understanding for lifelong experiences

Achieve: Striving to do our personal best with courage and commitment

Each of these attributes work in two ways. Firstly is the aspiration of what every member of our school community can and should expect when at Amaroo.

Welcome to Atwell Primary School.

We are a proud Independent Public School which promotes an environment where students learn to take responsibility for their actions, respect and value diversity, and see themselves as global citizens who can contribute to a more peaceful and sustainable world.

At Atwell, we believe that every child has the right to the best possible education, and the educational process is best served when the school, the child, the teacher and the parent/carer work together in a positive way to support learning.

We want to maintain a culture in the school where students are actively engaged in the curriculum and are provided with interesting ways to learn; where they feel cared for by school staff and develop a sense of belonging to the school; and where teachers know them well, build on their strengths and encourage them to persist with tasks until they succeed.

Our staff are passionate, enthusiastic and strive to ensure our school attests to the vision statement of 'building well-rounded citizens with a passion for lifelong learning'.

The teachers and support staff have a wide range of experience and are dedicated to enabling our 820 Kindergarten to Year 6 students to participate in shaping a better shared future for the world.

We endeavour to build students' resiliency skills and values through our Health and Wellbeing program, School Chaplaincy program and the partnerships we form with the parents and wider community.

Our school is currently implementing the Western Australian Curriculum. Students are offered specialist programs in the areas of music, visual arts, physical education and Italian. We provide our students with leadership opportunities and acknowledge their achievements in the areas of academics, physical education and the arts.

Our focus is developing critical thinking skills, strong interpersonal skills and relationships and provide them with opportunities to develop their knowledge and understanding of digital technologies.

After school enrichment programs are offered in Term 2 and 3 to allow students the opportunity to participate in specialised activities such as robotics, engineering, urban art, dance and a number of sporting activities.

Our school connects with the wider community by establishing strong partnerships to support the school. We are an active member of the Cockburn Central Education Network which was formed to support Atwell College, Lakeland Senior High School and their partner primary schools to improve student outcomes.

The network is a Kindergarten to Year 12 inclusive model and works as closely as possible with other established networks. The network is based on a collaborative, consultative approach and there is a genuine commitment by the leadership teams of these schools to establish a real and authentic network that delivers change.

Students from Year 5 and 6 are invited to attend after school programs at Atwell College through the Atwell Zone Extension Program. These programs are developed to extend students' prior knowledge and skills.

Outstanding leadership is a priority at Atwell Primary School and an emphasis has been placed on development of school leaders at all levels. While research clearly shows that in a school, individual teachers have the greatest impact on student learning, research also shows that the quality of a school's leadership has the second greatest impact on student learning.

Our school promotes strong, shared leadership; building leadership expertise; developing a culture of sharing and responsibility, to be facilitated by leaders; and tailoring initiatives to be included in the Business Plan. These will be strategically planned, implemented, monitored and evaluated by school leaders.

The School Board plays an active role in establishing and maintaining clear directions for the school and works in partnership with the wider community.

The P&C provides strong support to the school and organises a variety of activities that bring our school community together. Over recent years the P&C has been extremely active in providing equipment and facilities that have enhanced our school and learning opportunities for our students.

There are four teaching blocks, 12 transportable classrooms, two purpose built early childhood buildings, a library, staffroom, undercover area and a multi-purpose hall. The school environment and facilities are well maintained to ensure they cater for the needs of our students through ample play areas and grounds.

I join the staff in wishing you and your family a happy, rewarding and memorable association with our wonderful school.

Babakin Primary School,5020,"

At Babakin Primary School we make a difference in how students feel, learn and develop so that every student can achieve their personal best, feel happy and build confidence for tackling all life's future challenges. Our school is small, but our ambition for our students is not. We prepare students to take their place in the wider world with confidence and success, guiding their learning from Kindergarten to Year 6 through individual education plans. In addition, we run a 0-4 program called KidzKonnecting at which we welcome young children from the surrounding area to develop their early learning and social skills, accompanied by a parent/caregiver.

We provide students with opportunities to access the Western Australian Curriculum in full, as best meets their age and needs. Literacy and Numeracy are key areas and are prioritised in the morning. Educators work in teams to ensure that all students are supported and extended. Students are taught not just the curriculum subjects, but how to learn, how to study cooperatively and how to think about their learning to make it as powerful as possible. Science and Japanese are taught as specialist subjects. Incursions, excursions and links with technology and the wider world are used to enhance learning and the pleasure of learning.

The school is very well equipped, with a flexible learning area to optimise teaching of Literacy and Numeracy in groups designed to optimise support, cooperation and challenge. Our facilities include a heritage building used for visual and musical creativity and a modern, free-standing building which serves as an inquiry hub for Science, creative STEM projects and Japanese, along with a well-stocked lending library. Our students' learning is supported by technology, with ample and varied devices and structured teaching in their use.

Babakin is approximately 250 km east of Perth. We cater for the largely agricultural area between Corrigin, our nearest town, and Bruce Rock, our shire town. There has been a school at Babakin since 1915 and our centenary was celebrated with pride in 2015. The grounds and buildings are cared for by dedicated staff and engaged students who enjoy using the synthetic oval, hard court, undercover area, gardens and playground. The community's outstanding support, focussed through the P&C and Council, facilitates continual improvement in programs and facilities.

Babakin Primary School is at the heart of its community, yet outward-looking. We value our relationships with neighbouring schools in our Lakes Network and from outside the immediate area, through collegial and professional links. Our school has a Scientist-in-Schools partner at the University of Western Australia to enrich science learning and actively engages with Scitech, CSIRO, the Sustainable Schools network and wheat belt organisations that welcome our students and stimulate their curiosity. In 2018 we initiated an artist-in-residence project creating a triptych painting of our local bushland fauna and in 2019 will further celebrate Babakin's place in the world - its 'natural history' - through studies of the local wildflowers.

These areas allow the students to use their imagination to create with the found objects that abound in this area. The library is used by the Bakers Hill Out of School Care program and Holiday Care program.

Students study Italian as a second language from Years 1 to 6. Science, Music and Physical Education are taught as specialist subjects in all primary classes. The Bakers Hill Primary School Choir won the primary school choir competition at the Northam Arts Festival in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Ballajura Community College (BCC) is one of the largest providers of the Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) courses in the North East Metropolitan Region. Our College provides a high quality educational experience for all students and has remained committed to providing a range of flexible programs catering for all student interests, needs and abilities.

Our College's flexibility in curriculum provision, our vibrant engaging environment, and our focus on learning and teaching, provides our students with the opportunity to achieve excellent educational outcomes and the skills to move into further education and training or directly into the workplace.

A Department of Education endorsed specialist program for Advanced Curriculum Enrichment (ACE) operates through Years 7 to 10, promoting higher level thinking skills and academic achievement in Mathematics, English, Science and Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS). This provides a solid foundation for students entering our highly successful university pathway.

As a Registered Training Organisation (RTO), the College provides a range of certificate courses for students that complement their WACE courses of study. Demand for these courses continues to grow with many students completing a Vocational Education and Training (VET) Certification qualification as part of their WACE. We also provide an alternative program pathway, ACCESS, which has demonstrated outstanding success in engaging young people in education.

The Education Support program also provides opportunities, activities and facilities for students with special needs to master skills that will make them successful members of society. As an Independent Public School (IPS) we recognise that progress towards targets concerning attainment, retention, attendance, WACE and VET outcomes will continually need to be met and, wherever possible, exceeded.

Ballajura Community College is culturally diverse with more than fifty nationalities found within the whole learning community. It is an accredited International Fee Paying School. This diversity adds to the richness and the quality of the educational experience for all students. Our College provides an extra-curricular program with strong sporting, cultural, artistic, public speaking, service and leadership opportunities that continues to flourish and complement the more formal learning experienced by our students.

The College is also a Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) school and our core values of Respect, Equity, Achievement, Health and Care (REACH) underpin our mission - 'to create a vibrant learning community where excellence in learning and teaching is expected and celebrated where our College community feels valued and affirmed.'

The 'Baynton West Way' has become a way of life for many of our students and staff. Integrity, innovation, dedication and caring are our key guiding beacons, and our school vision of, 'Children are at the heart of our school' embodies everything we do, every day.

Entwined in that vision is our moral purpose of making sure children exceed their academic potential and that their emotional and social needs are met. We have observed over the years that children's self-esteem is boosted by achievement and progress brought about by hard work and regular school attendance.

We recognise that we work in close partnership with our children's family and that we are a team in the learning process. We acknowledge the support of the silent majority who assist their children through homework, morning reading, attending meetings, and by being 'present' throughout the primary school years.

We embrace the challenge of providing our students with a rich and responsive curriculum, promoting high achievement and excellence through ongoing self-reflection and goal setting, heavily emphasising English, mathematics and science. An integrated future focused curriculum which caters for diverse learning styles prepares children for life in 21st century. The cross curricular priority of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) creates opportunities for children to challenge existing understandings and take the lead in the education process. Together with our innovative approach to languages (Mandarin), our students are at the forefront and primed for a successful future. We have tight bonds with the community and regularly call on expertise to enhance our ambitious, child centred targets.

As a proud Positive Behaviour School (PBS), we understand the need to teach 'behaviour' as part of our curriculum. We use four positive powers (Becky Be Your Best, Safety Boy, Rosie Responsibility and Mr Resilient) to educate children about how to work with others and be part of a functioning group. Positive social behaviours are not assumed, instead they are explicitly taught through our PBS program that is woven throughout every aspect of our life at school.

With strong School Board governance and an active P&C we work closely with our parent community and they provide us with opportunities to enrich the lives students in our care.

As a relatively new school in Karratha, our traditions have formed powerful foundations over the past five years and we are constantly seeking ways to work with our community. We are proud of the support our parents provide which contributes to the wonderful atmosphere throughout our school.

Our strong and courageous leaders, students, parents, caregivers and staff bring fun and laughter to our school on a daily basis. Our students definitely turn lemons into lemonade.

Students arrive by bus from suburbs throughout the South Metropolitan Region. Some have experienced limited formal schooling and will stay for up to two years. Others will stay for shorter periods as they develop English language and cultural understandings before returning to their local schools. IEC students are highly valued and contribute significantly to enriching our school community.

Beaconsfield Primary School has a very active and supportive Parent and Citizens (P&C) group and an effective School Board. They support our school with the canteen and uniform shop, while also providing opportunities for the school community to engage with each other through school discos, community nights, busy bees, quiz nights and fundraising.

The school has a partnership with WANSLEA which provides before and after school care to students. We have also partnered with Playgroup WA to run on-site sessions each week.

A special feature of the Beldon Education Support Centre (ESC, 'the Centre') is the ambience. Parents, teachers, administrators and education assistants share the same vision for the Centre and strive endlessly to ensure that it runs smoothly and maintains a high standard of excellence. The benefit of this positive working relationship is that the students receive a top level of education that will enable them to become successful members of our society.

The Centre enrols children from areas other than the suburb of Beldon. The Centre has a bus service that delivers students from areas North, South and East of Beldon.

The Centre staff consist of a principal and three teachers - with an average length of service at the school of about five years - and non-teaching staff including seven Education Assistants and the Registrar.

An integral part of the Centre is the use of comprehensive Collaborative Action Plans (CAP's). These plans are developed by teachers, parents and therapists for each student and detail the learning outcomes for all eight learning areas. The CAP's form the basis for teaching, assessment and reporting at the Centre. All of those involved in the education of the students engage in the formation and monitoring of the CAP (parents, primary school teachers, ESC teachers and therapists).

The Centre's learning technology program is both intense and purposeful. Students have access to computers, photocopiers and telephones. An excellent ratio of one computer for every three students is maintained. The Centre delivers training and access to not only the computer hardware, but also to relevant software for all students.

Weekly staff meetings with all staff (including clerical and education assistants) enable all staff to discuss student needs and be informed of coming events.

There is an active Advisory Group which sets the direction and determines policies and priorities for the Centre.

Bibra Lake Primary School,5686,"

Our purpose is to ensure that all students develop the knowledge, skills and confidence to achieve their individual potential and contribute to society.

Our vision for Bibra Lake School is that individual student needs are met through teaching and learning programs, which reflect current 'Best Practice'. The staff demonstrate and incorporate the Values from the Curriculum Framework into their teaching programs. Students are supported and encouraged to aspire to develop their sense of these values.

The school seeks to provide an educational program that caters for a broad spectrum of abilities, needs and interests of students and to have clear links with parents and the local community. An example of the partnerships between the school and and the community is the replacement of aging play equipment which is well used by the community outside school hours as well as during the school day. The P&C fundraised over $15,000 for the project with the school funding the remainder. Students are active members of the community, providing entertainment by the choir, band and dance group to our local retirement village and local community centre.

Bibra Lake has very attractive school grounds with large open spaces for children to play safely. The location next to the Bibra Lake conservation area enhances the curriculum. Teachers, parents and their children have a great deal of pride in their school and many ex-students return to renew their links with the school.

Music Program
The extra curricula music program has a high level of participation by the students. A Senior Choir and Dance Group have performed for several years at Burswood with distinction and have performed in many other external venues. The school participates in the School of Instrumental Music Program, with students from Year 6 and 7. The students from this group form the School Band which performs regularly, with many students carrying on their music at high school.

Science Program
Bibra Lake Primary School has been selected as one of the four Australian schools to trial a national science and literacy program called 'Primary Connections'. The purpose of the project is to improve students' learning outcomes in science and literacy. The project will provide a comprehensive approach to the development of scientific literacy and will support the development of 'multi-literacies' which are essential for learning science. Well developed literacy skills and understandings are essential for the effective teaching and learning of concept development and the learning of higher thinking and problem solving skills.

Learning Technologies
A modern well resourced and automated library resource centre is a focal point of the school. A technology centre enables teachers to teach whole classes computing skills as part of their curriculum. All classes are networked so that this work can continue in the classrooms.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

Broome is located on the shores of Roebuck Bay in the Kimberley region of Australia. It is 2200kms away from Perth, the capital city of Western Australia. Broome has an interesting history based around the exploits of the men and women who developed the pearling industry in the 1880s. This history has created a population that is a melting pot of Asian, European and Indigenous cultures. Broome is rich in Aboriginal culture and is the traditional home of the Djugun Yawuru people.

Students at Broome Primary School and their backgrounds reflect the traditional, historical and multicultural aspects of the Broome community as well as the growth associated with activities such as agriculture, tourism, the provision of services and small business. The school still has the original Broome school building built in 1901 in the centre of its grounds.

Parents are valued at our school and we provide lots of opportunities for you to be involved in school life. Together we work with you and your child so they feel confident to try new things, learn and grow capabilities that will set them up for life.

The main campus is co-located with Rockingham Lakes Primary School situated in St Michel Estate in Port Kennedy. The school also has satellite classes at Mandurah Primary School, Pinjarra Primary School and Bungaree Primary School. The concept of a 'school within a school' is unique within the educational landscape of Western Australia and breaks new ground for the delivery of programs for children with a primary language disorder.

This fostering of co-operation and collaboration between these school communities provides opportunities for integrated and inclusive planning and delivery of a unique program within a friendly school environment.

Classes are structured to ensure optimal outcomes for our students. We have two full time classes: one for Kindergarten to Year 2 and the other for Years 3 to 6. Students learn in a nurturing environment that focuses on fostering a passion for life-long learning. We provide students with many opportunities to participate in a variety of activities including incursions, excursions and clinics. Students in Years 5 and 6 also attend a biannual camp.

We offer a diverse range of subjects including robotics, visual arts and music. Other specialist areas include physical education, science and French. Technology is used extensively with students regularly using computers, iPads and robotics. We begin every week with a student assembly where exemplary behaviour, working towards goals and positive attitudes are discussed and rewarded.

Our school's learning and teaching culture of 'Excellence' and our strong sense of community drives our vision - to prepare students to be positive and flexible learners enabling each student to achieve to their maximum potential.

Our challenge is to further develop our students as successful, motivated learners. We are confident that this approach along with targeted learning can be achieved with the support of strong partnerships between the school and the school community. Together we are building the learning foundations and futures of our children.

Our school enjoys a strong community spirit with close, supportive relationships existing between students, staff, parents and the community. The Calingiri School Council works with the principal to set and monitor the key directions and continued development of our school. The council includes representatives from parents, staff, P&C Association and the community. The proactive P&C Association continues to support the school with numerous fundraising campaigns to assist in the provision of resources and equipment for the school.

We encourage you to visit our school to learn more.

THE QUALITY PATHWAY TO UNIVERSITY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

In December 2017 the Western Australian Department of Education Director General announced that 'Canning College will become Western Australia's dedicated provider of education programs for overseas fee paying international students completing senior secondary programs or their equivalent. This is part of the Government commitment to strengthen international education in Western Australia'.

The announcement builds on our 33 year history as Western Australia's leading pathway to university for international students. While we have a special relationship with the universities of Perth, college graduates can enrol at all universities across Australia and at many universities across the world. Our graduates have studied at universities in Australia, England, Ireland, America, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore.

Our curriculum has been tailored to meet the specific learning needs of international students and provides multiple entry and exit points to best support the transition across education systems and progress to university. International students can commence enrolment in Year 10, Year 11 or Year 12, and at first year university level in Business. Bridging programs of various lengths support the flexible entry arrangements are also offered.

In 2018, 39 students (35% of our February start Western Australian Universities' Foundation Program students) received an Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank between 95 and 100, placing them in the top 5% of all university entrants in Australia. These students came from Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran, Korea, India and Zambia. 66% of graduates were eligible to access a 'Group of 8' university and 83% of all graduates met university entrance requirements. These students are now studying engineering, agricultural science, biomedical science (pathway to medicine), marine science, commerce, design, architecture, law, actuarial science, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, medical imaging, nursing, pharmacy, computing, arts and many more.

In a 2018 student survey of international students in Australian schools which offer international education, our students expressed a much higher level of satisfaction than students in all schools across the indicators of learning (95.7% vs 83.1%); arrival and reception (84.6% vs 78.9%), and support for students (97.5% vs 85.6%). This survey was conducted by igraduate, an independent research group.

A student from Hong Kong who graduated in 2018 said, 'Enrolling in Canning College helped me to achieve my goal of entering physiotherapy. I studied the Western Australian Universities' Foundation Program and earned a place in physiotherapy for 2019. The teachers and staff were very helpful in assisting me with subject choices and in helping me to understand what was needed to be successful at Canning College and at university. The staff know the curriculum very well and have a broad knowledge of university programs. As Canning College is very close to Curtin University, the campus was familiar to me when I started my degree which made it easier to settle in. Overall, the Canning College program, staff and environment provided excellent preparation - academically and personally - to perform well at university' - now studying physiotherapy at Curtin University.

Our staff members regularly visit major cities in China and Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia (West and East), Vietnam, Indonesia and Zambia. Opportunities are available for potential students and their parents to meet with officers at education exhibitions and other events. We also has extensive partnerships with international education agents throughout South East Asia and Africa.

At Canning Vale College, our staff are committed to our vision of 'Creating Futures' for every child. This is achieved when each child leaves with the knowledge, skills and values to transition to university, further training or employment. We believe our strong partnership with you, and your child, ensures we achieve this aim.

We are a large, comprehensive and modern secondary school catering for children from Years 7 to 12. Your child benefits from the variety of subject choices and resources, including specialist teachers and state of the art facilities offering the best chance of achieving at the highest level.

We consider your child's care a team responsibility. Our dedicated Student Engagement and Support team includes a nurse, psychologists, chaplain, youth workers, and external support agencies. Our code of conduct and behaviour management policy supports our commitment to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all.

Personal pathway planning for each child aligns each child's aspirations with their capability and results. Everyone in Years 7 to 10 study maths, science, English, humanities and social sciences, physical education, with options to study the arts, languages and technology and enterprise. Children in Years 11 and 12 have opportunities to choose a pathway focused on their chosen career. Our external relationships support and enrich the education opportunities provided.

Children with learning difficulties, disabilities or needing additional support are supported to achieve their very best.

Canning Vale Education Support Centre,6089,"

Canning Vale Education Support Centre's motto is 'For Life We Learn'.

Our school community believes that our students with special needs should all be supported to learn essential independent living skills, acceptable social skills and effective communication skills, to become happy, resilient members of society. We pride ourselves on the programs we offer, (including early intervention) to enable students to develop independence. Our other teaching and learning programs reflect this belief too, and accordingly are delivered by teachers using a variety of teaching strategies to suit the differing learning styles of students and to enable students to work towards and achieve their individual goals. Every student has an 'Individual Education Plan' with pertinent short term and long term goals developed through team work, with the student's parents and associated therapists and teaching staff, and then delivered though our specialised programs.

We have a proactive school board comprising mainly parents, staff and two community members and have a positive school community with a high, annual, attendance rate. Every classroom has the sign 'Positive Voices' displayed and we all endeavour to follow this simple school devised strategy so that classrooms only ever have quiet teaching voices and positive comments at all times, whether it is a compliment or to redirect behaviour.

Visitors to our classrooms (of which there are many) often comment on the 'on task' and quiet, contented demeanour of the students. We use visual cues to redirect students and to wait for them to make a good choice - there are no harsh words.

Once students have learnt to stay with their group when moving around our school grounds (a shared campus with co-located Canning Vale primary school) they are able to participate in our most popular program, Community Access Training Program (CATP). CATP comprises students learning to use public transport safely, to navigate safely as pedestrians and to be considerate of other members of the public and to be mindful of their own safety (Protective Behaviours) in public situations. Every student has a Smartcard and a Companion Card. Our students are excellent role models for those students who have never experienced direct community access training and the associated protective behaviours.

In all our classrooms, the emphasis is on independent living and functional academics. Students are offered cooking, laundry, self-care, gardening and housekeeping sessions and computer and iPad sessions. It is not unusual for students to harvest vegetables from the garden to use in their cooking activities. The school now has an independent living and sensory building which has been specifically built with cooking and laundry and relaxation facilities for students. The nearby copse of Casuarina trees is a wonderful, peaceful place for students to just enjoy being a part of nature.

Our kindergarten and pre-primary students are offered early intervention programs with evidenced based 'Applied Behavioural Analysis Philosophy' strategies adhered to, to ensure student progress through incremental steps to achieve outcomes. We follow an accelerated curriculum (ALCA) for those students who will go onto their local schools for year one and deliver it at a slower pace to deliver this curriculum to students who require it.

We consider 'joining in' activities essential to enable students to participate outside of school in the community. We offer three dance programs and a school conga dance session. Swimming and bowling are features of our 'joining in' focus and we encourage integration into mainstream, art and physical education classes and all our students participate in the annual primary school athletics carnival. Our year five and six students also participate in an annual camp.

We are committed to providing a healthy and safe learning environment.

We believe teachers have the right to teach and students have the right to learn. Classroom and playground rules exist to protect these rights and ensure everyone's safety.

We encourage students to demonstrate active citizenship through the behaviour and practices both within and outside the school environment. Our focus is towards others rather than self-interest. We promote strategies that lead to the development of resilience and leadership traits. We have a strong protective behaviours philosophy running right through the school and explicitly teach these vital skills to our students.

Canning Vale Primary School students learn tolerance, empathy and understanding first hand because we share the campus with an Education Support Centre. Students attending the Centre integrate into the primary school for activities whenever appropriate. The school is also wonderfully multi-cultural and staff create rich learning programs that allow students and staff to share experiences and knowledge.

As an Independent Public School since 2012, we work closely and in partnership with our community, in particular the School Board and the Parents and Citizens Association (P&C).

Cape Naturaliste College,4178,"

Situated in the South West township of Vasse, (15km South West of Busselton), Cape Naturaliste College opened with its first Year 8 students in February 2008.

Drawing from the catchment areas of Dunsborough, Vasse and West Busselton, it has a socio economic index of 101.2. With the growth in the region it is expected that the enrolments will continue to rise as the college increases to Year 12 in 2012.

The college was built at a cost of $21 million and has already attracted positive comments and awards for its original design. It was developed with a strong community input and a consultative steering committee of parents and community members was instrumental in developing its vision and ethos, uniform and emblem.

Considerable work and planning was expended in developing a middle schooling structure for its Year 8 and 9 and work has begun on a model for its Years 10 to 12 senior school structures.

The college priorities are Literacy and cooperative learning - a focus designed to support staff and students in the learning community. The College also has embraced Instructional Leadership and this links closely with performance management and mentor structures.

Capel Primary School is located in a quiet, picturesque semi rural setting bordered by the Capel River to the east and farmland to the south. The spacious school grounds and lush playing fields are enhanced by red gum and peppermint trees and an area of remnant bush in the north-west corner.

The hundred year history of the school (1898) is reflected in an aesthetically pleasing blend of old and recent buildings, providing excellent facilities for students and staff. The 'old Stratham' School building located in the grounds is held in great pride by the community and provides a strong link to the past. Funding through the Commonwealh Government Building the Education Revolution program has provided 4 modern classrooms to replace the 1920's classrooms, an Art/Science and Music specialist facility and resources that complement existing facilities and ensure students at Capel PS continue to receive the best educational opportunities in a modern learning environment.

Students enrol at Capel School because of its emphasis on educational excellence, warm friendly tone, value placed on good citizenship, commitment to school, pleasant surroundings and the variety of programs on offer.

Traditionally Capel was a small rural school servicing the town and farming community. Mineral sands mining in the sixties brought changes to the district with an increased student population. Numbers have further increased since viticulture, coastal development, rural subdivisions and expansion of the south west has occurred. Students from a variety of socio economic backgrounds attend the school with high attendance levels and a strong community commitment clearly evident.

Capel PS commenced a new era of education through its selection during 2010 as an Independent Public School. With commencement as an IPS during 2011 the school was able to select staff to implement a collaborative teaching & learning program and introduce Kagan Co-operative learning strategies. The flexibilities of being an IPS have allowed for additional innovative programs to be implemented on an identified needs basis. This has included the employment of a Speech Therapist to work with students and staff across the junior primary as an early intervention strategy. It has also included an increase in time for non-teaching staff to provide expertise in further early intervention strategies, the Art/Science learning area and to assist with developing a range of enrichment programs.

School Programmes:
Emphasis is on improving literacy and numeracy results, with a 'whole-school' approach. Getting it Right literacy & numeracy specialists are appointed to support this. The 'Diana Rigg' program has been implemented across the school and additional Speech Therapy support is provided for students with identified needs.

* A strong commitment to using Technology as a learning tool is clearly evident within the school and improvements to the classroom infrastructure and the purchase of new equipment further supports the Getting it Right Technology strategy. Capel students from Year 1 - 7 have access to computers at a ratio of 2:1, Interactive Whiteboards in each room, document cameras, a computer laboratory situated in the library, digital cameras and video cameras for class work and movie making projects.
* A strong emphasis on health and fitness achieves low levels of student obesity and many sporting successes. Capel is an 'Asthma Friendly School'. A Physical Education specialist works across years P-7.
* Environmental education includes interaction with the community in bush land rehabilitation, river quality, 'Waste Wise School' activities and accreditation as a 'Water Wise School'. The school is currently developing in partnership with the School Board a 'sustainability' vision.
* A program promoting positive social skills and values is conducted across the school and supported by a community funded chaplain. High expectations are placed on student behaviour and the community strongly supports the positive learning environment and reward systems embedded in the school culture.
* A whole school 'Positive Behaviour Support' program is being implemented with teacher involvement on the committee to develop school rules, enhance reward systems and ensure 'replacement behaviours' are taught.
* The arts are emphasized through music and movement with opportunities to learn a variety of musical instruments and become a member of the school choir. A music specialist works across Years 1-7 and is supplemented by the talents of various staff in the Visual Arts domain.
* The adoption of a sister school in Bali has enriched the Indonesian LOTE program and given it a community focus. Many families from Capel have visited the sister school and established close links with communication ongoing between the students.
* Enrichment programs in Numeracy, Science and the Arts have been introduced during 2011 with a high level of success.
* Clubs - where students have access to a range of activities on a monthly rotation are held each week and involve the Year 5-7 classes. Many parent and community volunteers have supported this concept and introduced a range of programs that have engaged and motivated the students.

Enrolment at Capel Primary School is a life style choice for many and the school is highly valued within the community and District.

Carey Park Primary School currently has 315 students from kindergarten to Year 6. We are situated in the city of Bunbury, 170 kilometres south of Perth. Opened in 1955 for students in Years 1 to 3, the original structure remained in use until 2000 when the new, state-of-the-art two storey building was completed. Classes commenced in the new facilities at the beginning of the 2001 school year. The school was successful in becoming an Independent Public School in 2013.

Carnarvon School Of The Air,5926,"

Carnarvon, located on the coast in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia's northwest is noted for its moderate subtropical climate. The town (pop approx. 5500) supports an extensive pastoral and horticultural industry and prawn and snapper fishery. Students on remote pastoral stations in the region are widely scattered in a 500km radius of the town and beyond the reach of normal education services. The school was established in 1968 to provide education services to students through the Royal Flying Doctor Service radio network and the state Correspondence School. The high frequency radio network was phased out in 2004 and IT based lessons and online programs are now delivered via satellite and supplemented with set work curriculum materials.

Carnarvon School of the Air (CSOTA) is one of 5 schools of the Air based in Western Australia. In the home school room students are assisted by a home tutor, usually the children's mother or a hired tutor. Students 'meet' their fellow students daily on-air in their 'virtual classroom' where teachers conduct lessons with the capacity for each student to see each other.

Teachers visit their students and home tutors to provide face to face learning support required to meet the educational needs of each individual. Students also meet at a number of locations throughout the year to engage in educational programs.

The school conducts training for home tutors and new parents at its annual Home Tutors Seminar. Parents, teachers, home tutors and students meet for a week of professional development and class lessons. Teachers and visiting speakers keep Home tutors up to date with the latest developments in curriculum resources and teaching practice. The school provides professional teaching support, educational programs and information and resources.

The school has a comprehensive and well-resourced curriculum encompassing a blend of online and written materials. Work is submitted electronically to teachers as it is completed. This allows for student feedback to be more immediate. Teachers plan, review and consolidate student materials incorporating attendance at school events where school work is completed face to face. Individual Learning Plans are established for students to cater for individual learning needs.

Time, distance and weather conditions are major factors affecting the delivery of educational services. Technology increasingly helps overcome the tyranny of distance. Satellite technologies are used to enable more rapid and timely communication between home-tutor, teacher and student. Over time this has enhanced the educational outcomes for our students.

The curriculum offerings at Carnarvon SOTA continue to expand with the school utilising a Language program delivered through SIDE, numerous online learning platforms, music tuition, an extension program for Talented and Gifted students and a support teacher to provide for students with learning difficulties.

Home tutors are a key part of students' engagement with the learning program. To this end, home tutors are invited to participate in seminars and school based events. Regular email and telephone contact as well as teacher visits to families, further support the role of the home tutor.

The school is supported by a School Council, which consists of parent community and staff representatives, including the Principal. This group plays a key role in providing school community input into school planning and decisions. The P&C Association also provides strong support to the school and its students.

Carson Street is the State's only Primary Education Support School and it educates students whose needs are such that they are not presently being integrated into the regular school system. All require extensive therapy and educational services. Students have a wide variety of medical conditions which are handled sensitively by the nursing staff. The School is located within the Town of Victoria Park but the catchment extends from the Swan River to Carmel in the surrounding hills. Students graduate in the year they turn 11 and most then transfer to Kensington Secondary School.

Highlights include being one of the first to be granted Independent Public School status in 2010 and being selected as one of the first Teacher Development Schools in Western Australia. The school community is justifiably proud of this formal recognition of its programs and practices.

The staff believe that the influence of a student's family is extremely important to a child's progress and achievement; therefore cooperation between home and school is vital. Home-school diaries, regular newsletters and special activity days keep parents informed and involved in their child's learning program. The school is currently introducing the SEN reporting process as an improved method of reporting progress to parents.
Detailed attention is paid to individual needs. Planning, monitoring and assessment of students using Individual Education Plans and high quality teaching and learning programs result in maximising outcomes for our students. High expectations drive improvements and the school aims at providing a happy, safe and caring environment for students and staff.

Staff are skilled in promoting communication through the use of Alternative and Augmentative Communication strategies, including Aided Language Stimulation and the use of PODD (Pragmatic Organisation Dynamic Displays). The latter is effectively supporting a dramatic improvement in many students' communication. Computer and other assistive technologies are often used as a means of promoting independent learning.

With the general movement towards inclusion, early intervention has become a priority and staff believe that they can play a valuable role in preparing many young children with disabilities for inclusive learning environments as well as providing an exemplary program for those who remain with us for their primary schooling. Early Intervention opportunities, including our unique Conductive Education (Parent and Child) and My Time programs are highly effective due to the expertise of our staff, the quality of the learning opportunities and the way we work with other professionals and parents.

Carson Street School is adapting its facilities and services to the current inclusive educational climate and is ready to play a positive role in the education of special needs students in the future.

THE NATURE OF THE CATCHMENT AREA AND THE COMMUNITY

Cascade Primary School is located 100 kilometres North West of Esperance set amongst beautiful Gum and Mallee bushland. The climate throughout the year is mild to moderate and generally comfortable.
No fuel or shopping facilities are available within the Cascade town site, however, a community operated Recreation Centre with updated kitchen and recreation facilities provides for various social and sporting opportunities. The closest town is 50 km South to Munglinup.

Cascade Primary School first opened at a site southeast of its current locality in 1974. This school was made up of a series of transportable buildings. After efforts by the local community, the government opted to build a new permanent structure to facilitate 100 children. This site was opened on the 17th July 1981. Our enrolments generally fluctuate between 20 and 30 students so we have lots of space for individualised teaching programs.

All students arrive on one of the three school buses from large agricultural operations, namely broad acre crop and sheep farming.

SCHOOL DESCRIPTION

Due to the varying nature of numbers the classes are usually of two or three teacher configuration.
At the moment two multi-age grouped classes consist of K-2 and Years 3 - 6. Four-year old students attend on average 15 hours each week over the school year. Each room has a full time teacher's aide.

Our School Direction:
Cascade Primary strives to foster respect for one another, build on the strengths of students and extend their achievements in an inclusive learning environment. The teaching and learning planning is based upon a sound knowledge of students, pedagogy and content. We believe students learn best when an individual's health and well-being is the foundation for learning, when flexible learning opportunities are provided and when teaching and learning processes and strategies promote life- long learners.

The core values of our school are:
A positive approach to learning that is encouraged in others, high expectations of students and staff which results in high standards of social and academic achievement, the recognition of the differing circumstances and needs of all students and dedication to achieving the best possible outcomes.

Other significant features of Cascade Primary include a 'sustainability ethos' and a whole school approach to social and emotional health, modelled on the Kids Matter framework and implemented through a health curriculum based Peer Support program, both of which are supported by staff, parents and the wider school community.
ICT plays a vital role in student learning and recently we have seen the development of a comprehensive ICT operational plan and improved infrastructure. The updating of interactive whiteboards in each of the teaching areas, laptops and the introduction of updated iPads into the Junior Classroom in the foreseeable future, will enable technology to be integrated across all learning areas.
Strategies to improve academic results are based upon a whole school approach, best practice utilising appropriate teaching strategies and the rigorous analysis of data to inform planning. Staff engage in cyclical planning, teaching and assessment sequences. Collaboration amongst teaching and administration staff is seen as essential to the success of this planning.
Junior and Senior Mallee network meetings provide the platform for professional growth and the development of a shared department pedagogy.
The small schools of our network (Mallee) also often combine events to maximize students' socialization, including singing and drama performances/incursions, Interschool Athletics Carnivals, an annual Swimming Camp at Esperance and Bi-annual Yrs. 5 & 6 Canberra Camp and Senior Camp.
Teachers and Principals of these schools collaboratively plan, and support each other as a network.
Busy-bees are a regular feature in our school. The Grounds Committee has supported whole school bushfire preparation, addition of outside storage (sea containers) and the further improvement of a 'State of the Art' Junior Primary playground including fencing in a large nature play area and bicycle path.
The Cascade Primary/community recycling station is open to the community and the school Worm Farm reduces food waste.

SCHOOL DECISION-MAKING AND CONSULTATION PROCESS

The Level 3 Primary School benefits from significant community support, particularly through the School Council, the Parents and Citizens Association and the Grounds Committee sub- committee.
Fundraising has been recently directed towards learning and teaching resources such as:
- classroom infrastructure
- reading books
- library books
- laptops/ipads
-school freshen up (painting)
- human resource employment

Cascade Primary School has an active and dynamic School Council which the teachers and Principal attend and support. Whilst contributing to the school planning process the school council also
- contributes to determining the strategic direction of the school.
- revising and endorsing the school policies
- approving fees and contributions for the following year and
- ensuring the draft budget has given appropriate consideration to priorities

The school is widely recognised for its supportive community, the exceptional standard of resources and its proximity to the south coast (approximately 40kms).

The outcomes for students are rigorously set to ensure that appropriate and maximum learning occurs. Student assessment is conducted at regular intervals for diagnostic, reporting and placement purposes. Intensive monitoring is undertaken to guarantee success.

As well as emphasis upon research based academic programmes, our educational service promotes the development of values, knowledge and skills that our students can generalise across learning areas and use effectively in a variety of situations as adults.

Each student is encouraged to work at his or her own pace. Multi-aged grouping and cross-setting are key features at the Centre. In addition, we are conscious of the fact that not all children come to school with the same values and foundations for learning. We ensure that the learning at the Centre is culturally appropriate, inclusive and supportive.

Highly regarded in the community, the expertise and advice of the staff is sought by many other educators across the Pilbara. Our multi-disciplinary team of expert staff work in partnership with parents and the community to ensure that all students value the greatness in themselves and others and become proactive, independent, life-long learners who achieve their individual potential and contribute positively to society.

With a passion for equality and a commitment to excellence, our dedicated team work diligently to provide a safe, inspiring and supportive environment. We treat all individuals with care and respect.

Communication between school and home is essential so we ensure we keep parents and caregivers well informed of their child's progress, raise any issues and celebrate successes, when appropriate.

A very high, staff to student ratio enables us to provide individual attention to meeting students' needs.

The Centre enjoys the support of a range of other professional individuals and organisations that provide specialist support services, including but not limited to: physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, Child Health Nurse, Disability Services Commission, the Centre for Inclusive Schooling, West Australian Institute for Deaf Education, Vision Education Services and the Senses Foundation.

Students benefit not only from access to our professional staff, but also from access to modern specialist facilities and an extensive range of resources and equipment that help to deliver practical, hands-on learning that foster essential life skills.

We understand the needs of our students and work diligently to ensure that, together with families, we provide a holistic and relevant education that will prepare our students for the future in a modern world.

Parents of prospective students are most welcome to make contact with the Centre or to visit the Centre and take a guided tour. Please call the Centre to make an appointment.

Christmas Island District High School, is located 360 km southwest of Java and 2 600 km northwest of Perth. We cater for over 200 students from Pre-primary to Year 12 on our main site and more than 20 Kindergarten students at the Tom Patterson Kindergarten Centre. Our team of teachers and education assistants are selected through a rigorous merit selection process. Our school is well resourced which means class sizes are kept small and extra support is provided to classes in the areas of literacy, numeracy, information and communications technology, and pastoral care. Our commitment to valuing the home languages of the island means that students are offered the opportunity to learn either Mandarin or Bahasa Malay languages.

EARLY CHILDHOOD
Early childhood education begins with an early learning program for three year olds and a four year old Kindergarten based off-site. On-site, Pre-Primary and Year One students participate in student centred programs designed to enhance their early cognitive, social and emotional development. Specialist teachers develop and implement the music, visual art, information and communications technology, and physical education programs.

PRIMARY
We have a strong focus on literacy and numeracy in the primary years. Students also have the benefit of having specialist teachers develop and implement the music, art, design and technology, information and communications technology, and physical education programs. Our highly successful Opti-minds program develops students' critical and creative thinking skills as they learn to become more confident and autonomous problem-solvers and thinkers.

SECONDARY
In Years 7 to 10, there is the opportunity for students to choose learning pathways that match the individuals own interest and talents. Students in Years 7 and 8 complete a range of subjects. In Years 9 and 10 students are given the opportunity to choose some of their subjects. We offer a wide range of exciting and interesting options including outdoor education, visual arts, pottery, music, foods, childcare, textiles, woods, metals and digital technologies.

We offer a range of face-to-face courses as well as support and mentoring to students who are studying SIDE (School of Isolated and Distance Education) classes.

Christmas Island District High School is a safe, secure and happy school that respects and values its community, the environment, cultural diversity and innovative approaches. We support all students to achieve their potential.

Christmas Island District High School's highly regarded whole-school positive behaviour program means that students learn in a warm and caring environment. The program actively teaches students how to demonstrate our focus behaviours - 'show respect', 'be responsible' and 'challenge yourself'.

Our newly developed STEM laboratory means that students are provided with authentic learning challenges that foster critical and creative thinking skills. Students learn in a technology rich environment where students have access to technology such as 3D printers, lazer cutters and iPads. We run a one-to-one laptop program in secondary school which means students are better able to develop the 21st century skills required to be an active citizen in this age of information. The Trade Training Centre provides students with the ideal environment in which to use design thinking and technologies to generate solutions to real-world problems. Our library provides plenty of room for students to research, study or simply read a book in a warm and welcoming environment. The unique and spectacular natural environment, which is on our doorstep, also plays a large part in our science, humanities, arts and outdoor education programs, where students' natural curiosity about the world around them is nurtured and developed.

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands are made up of 27 small islands that form a horseshoe shaped atoll around a central lagoon, which is 8 kilometres wide. The total area of these islands is 14 square kilometres; the majority of this is taken up by West Island and Home Island. These two islands house a population of approximately 550 adults and children with the remaining islands being unpopulated. The population is made up of 90 mainland Australians that provide administration and other services to the Islands, with the remaining population being Australians of Cocos Malay descent living on Home Island. Since the 'Act of Self Determination' in 1984, a whole-island decision to integrate as an Australian Territory, the islands have modernised while maintaining many of the traditions and values associated with the Cocos Malay people and their religion.

Strong student focus and staff collaboration are the cornerstones of education at Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School. This platform enables the school community to develop a shared vision that encompasses Western Australian Department of Education priorities and enhances professional delivery of a dynamic and appropriate curriculum. Mindful of the unique situation of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the school is committed to the ongoing health and well-being of all, through an inclusive pastoral care culture. This school aims to maintain a vibrant, positive and flexible team who focus their energy in a united direction to achieve agreed targeted outcomes.

Staff have a commitment to ongoing professional development, including annually updated E.S.L. and Surf Lifesaving qualifications, which, given our geographical location, allow us to utilise the natural environment for student activities.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School comprises two campuses. The Home Island campus caters for Home Island Kindergarten to Year 6 students. The West Island campus, operates a Kindergarten to Year 6 primary school for West Island students and also houses the secondary school, Year 7-10. The majority of secondary students travel the 8 kilometres across the lagoon by ferry to and from school each day. At present, students continue their post-compulsory education at mainland schools. Comprehensive careers advice is provided to all students, and is complemented by work experience programmes both on and off-island.

Together with our families, we are taking up the challenge of providing an engaging, safe and outcomes focused learning environment where each individual is valued.

Our school plays an important role in maintaining social connections for our Kindergarten to Year 6 students, their families, staff and the wider community of Coorow located 265km north of Perth.

Our students enjoy a broad range of curriculum given our small enrolment and location. Students participate in weekly French, art, sport, health, science, history and geography, and library lessons. Our school also boasts an excellent range of ICT resources.

National testing at Year 3 and 5 show the majority of students are achieving above national minimum standards and 'like schools' in reading, writing, numeracy, language conventions and spelling. For students at educational risk, we provide up to 100 minutes per week of individualised intervention.

We access additional expertise in the arts, physical education and technology through incursions and excursions. Students also have the opportunity to participate in excursions and overnight camps with students from other schools as well as attend a bi-annual school camp to a number of destinations in Western Australia. All activities have a strong link to curriculum outcomes.

We consciously direct resources into early intervention and high quality Early Childhood Education. We pride ourselves on our purpose-built early childhood facilities and our ability to implement the Early Years Learning Framework in a well-maintained, welcoming environment.

Families are invited to begin their relationship with the school community by participating in our 3 Ups Kindy Readiness program. We aim to effectively form positive partnerships with families for the continuation of their child's learning journey.

We join a network of schools to participate in professional development, sport, curriculum-based projects, PEAC and leadership networking. This activity enables us to work in collaboration with neighbouring professionals to overcome issues relating to professional isolation, geography, small cohorts and resource sharing.

Our students are encouraged to set personal goals in their learning and behaviour. They are supported to reflect on their progress towards these goals. Our staff firmly believe all decisions should be made solely to improve student outcomes. They know their students well and always aim to develop classroom programs that reflect quality differentiated teaching practices.

Families are an important part of our school community and we actively seek their feedback and input into their child's education. Many Coorow families participate in the School Board, P&C and parent helper initiatives. We believe that children have better outcomes when families are informed and part of the journey.

To remain successful Coorow Primary School will be required to be responsive to external changes and act always to meet the learning needs of Coorow children and their families. Coorow Primary School Our school leadership will continue to nurture and develop strong relationships between home and school. We will also engage the support of the School Board, cultivate a positive partnership with the P&C and link with neighbouring schools both professionally and socially.

Carnarvon School Of The Air,5926,"

Carnarvon, located on the coast in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia's northwest is noted for its moderate subtropical climate. The town (pop approx. 5500) supports an extensive pastoral and horticultural industry and prawn and snapper fishery. Students on remote pastoral stations in the region are widely scattered in a 500km radius of the town and beyond the reach of normal education services. The school was established in 1968 to provide education services to students through the Royal Flying Doctor Service radio network and the state Correspondence School. The high frequency radio network was phased out in 2004 and IT based lessons and online programs are now delivered via satellite and supplemented with set work curriculum materials.

Carnarvon School of the Air (CSOTA) is one of 5 schools of the Air based in Western Australia. In the home school room students are assisted by a home tutor, usually the children's mother or a hired tutor. Students 'meet' their fellow students daily on-air in their 'virtual classroom' where teachers conduct lessons with the capacity for each student to see each other.

Teachers visit their students and home tutors to provide face to face learning support required to meet the educational needs of each individual. Students also meet at a number of locations throughout the year to engage in educational programs.

The school conducts training for home tutors and new parents at its annual Home Tutors Seminar. Parents, teachers, home tutors and students meet for a week of professional development and class lessons. Teachers and visiting speakers keep Home tutors up to date with the latest developments in curriculum resources and teaching practice. The school provides professional teaching support, educational programs and information and resources.

The school has a comprehensive and well-resourced curriculum encompassing a blend of online and written materials. Work is submitted electronically to teachers as it is completed. This allows for student feedback to be more immediate. Teachers plan, review and consolidate student materials incorporating attendance at school events where school work is completed face to face. Individual Learning Plans are established for students to cater for individual learning needs.

Time, distance and weather conditions are major factors affecting the delivery of educational services. Technology increasingly helps overcome the tyranny of distance. Satellite technologies are used to enable more rapid and timely communication between home-tutor, teacher and student. Over time this has enhanced the educational outcomes for our students.

The curriculum offerings at Carnarvon SOTA continue to expand with the school utilising a Language program delivered through SIDE, numerous online learning platforms, music tuition, an extension program for Talented and Gifted students and a support teacher to provide for students with learning difficulties.

Home tutors are a key part of students' engagement with the learning program. To this end, home tutors are invited to participate in seminars and school based events. Regular email and telephone contact as well as teacher visits to families, further support the role of the home tutor.

The school is supported by a School Council, which consists of parent community and staff representatives, including the Principal. This group plays a key role in providing school community input into school planning and decisions. The P&C Association also provides strong support to the school and its students.

Classes at Creaney ESC are typically small with an average of six children in each class staffed by one specially qualified teacher and usually three Level 3 Education Assistants. Children are taught using highly structured programs based on the principles of T.E.A.C.C.H, Applied Behaviour Analysis and direct instruction. Visual and communication supports are used throughout the school to encourage independence and to reduce anxious behaviours.

The high staff-to-student ratio allows for a mix of 1:1 instruction, independent work, small group and whole class instruction. Teaching is highly individualised with each child's learning program determined by an Individual Education Plan (IEP). IEPs are written at the beginning of each semester in collaboration with parents, staff and relevant professionals (such as therapists). They cover each learning area and describe the specific objectives to be taught.

Task Analysis is used to break academic and personal goals into small, fine-grained, progressive steps which are explicitly taught using a variety of strategies and specialised approaches. At the end of each semester, parents are provided with a written report which directly relates to each objective on the IEP. Reports include photographic evidence of skill attainment. Our focus is always on developing student independence, communication and self-regulation.

As well as our core program for children from Kindergarten to Year 6, Creaney ESC also offers a two- year Early Intensive Intervention Program. This program is for small groups of kindergarten and pre-primary aged children with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. It is based on the principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis and aims to equip these children with the skills necessary for entry into a mainstream Year 1 class.

Kindergarten children attend the program for 15 hours per week while the pre-primary aged children spend two days a week at our centre and three days at their local mainstream school. During this year, staff at Creaney ESC work closely with the children's local schools to support a successful transition to a full-time Year 1 placement.

'Inspire Create Achieve', it is these three key words that guides and motivates Dianella Secondary College to be a school that is innovative and dynamic. With a real focus on relationships, our professional staff are committed to ensure that exceptional learning opportunities exist for your child.

Dianella Secondary College, situated in Perth's northern suburbs, is a rich and vibrant multi-cultural environment that has a long history of producing successful and committed community members. Your child will have access to a varied curriculum that provides them the opportunity to explore and develop their own individual talents and passions. We provide engaging courses across all Learning Areas from Years 7-12 in the Arts, Health & Physical Education, Technology & Enterprise, Maths, Science, English and the Humanities. Dianella Secondary College also offers an extensive music program where students can join instrumental ensembles and singing groups.

Our specialist STEM enrichment program is an innovative and integrated approach to learning by combining key elements of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. It is offered to students to engage them in a collaborative manner and address the needs of 21st century skills and employment opportunities. Your child would be immersed in a creative environment, whereby they are encouraged and motivated to find solutions to real problems both locally and globally, while simultaneously addressing the requirements of the WA and Australian curriculum.

In Years 11 and 12 in preparation for further studies or employment, your child will have access to a wide range of ATAR courses, Vocational Education and Training courses at Certificate II and III level. Your child will also have access to School-based Traineeships and can access courses at TAFE or a private provider and still be enrolled at our school.

In addition to what we offer at Dianella Secondary College, we have developed the New North Education Initiative, a wonderful partnership with four other schools that allows Senior School students to access a wider breadth of courses with specialist teachers across five different campuses.

We have strong connections with our community and developed alliances with various educational institutions including, Edith Cowan University and the University of Western Australia; we have also forged partnerships with industry organisations, such as Royal Surf Life Saving WA, The Matilda Bay Rotary Club and The Smith Family. These relationships are developed for the benefit of your child, to aid their learning and provide them with the greatest opportunity to reach their full potential.

In conjunction with ECU's School of Education and Engagement Unit we have launched the University Pathway Scholarship for Dianella Secondary College students. This unique scholarship offers support to students throughout their high school journey, from Year 7, to assist them both academically and financially, to obtain university entrance after Year 12. It is a powerful way for us to ensure your child is achieving excellent results throughout their schooling.

There is a real belief among our staff that the learning journey is a team effort between our students, parents, teachers and community partners and it is this relationship that contributes to our on-going success. We are proud of the relationships we have developed and value the contributions that are made in supporting our school and students.

Dianella Secondary College Education Support Centre,6068,"

Dianella Secondary College Education Support Centre is a diverse multicultural secondary school that caters for students with disabilities from Years 7 to 13. We are located on the same site as Dianella Secondary College and Dianella College Primary School. Together, we have developed a positive relationship focused on supporting students and families.

We provide a safe and supportive learning environment, where the rights and responsibilities of the individual are recognised and respected. We encourage all students to realise their potential and inspire them to participate as responsible members of the community. We have been recognised by the local community as delivering a high calibre of education to our students.

Our educational programs focus on preparing students for transition to future employment, development of life skills required for independence, and the social and emotional development of young adults. The diverse range of programs on offer are developed and tailored to meet individual student needs.

Vocational Education and Training is one such program which enables students to develop industry specific skills through a variety of Nationally Credited Certificate Courses.

We also run Black Friday Enterprises, a program dedicated to engaging Year 10-13 students in innovative ventures in preparation for transition. It allows students to fulfil the requirements of the Certificate I in Retail and Business, assisting students in developing post-school craft skills that may enable them to start a micro-business of their own.

Workplace learning, for students in Year 10, assists in the development of skills that ensures our students are safe and successful when they go out to work experience. This program allows students to work in a 'simulated' workplace, completing either a Certificate I in Vocational Pathways or ASDAN.

STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is another program that we run school wide. STEM is designed to replicate the process that STEM professionals undertake when completing projects, encouraging and developing student resilience and problem solving - skills that are critical for their post-school life. There is a strong focus on hands-on, project-based learning, with students also having the opportunity to engage with many different digital technologies including building and coding robots and creating digital games.

Bushrangers is another program that we are proud to provide. Bushrangers allows students to take an active role in the conservation of the natural environment in their local community and the greater Perth region. Bushrangers provides practical life skills as well as leadership, teamwork and initiative skills; and promotes community responsibility and service.

We have proudly built a school where relationships are based on mutual respect and trust and where partnerships are valued. Developing strong relationships with students and parents has enhanced student learning. Parents are encouraged to take an active role in their child's education and have become an integral part in the development of educational programs.

We are proud of our students who leave our care poised to embrace new challenges in their communities.

ABOUT US

Djidi Djidi Aboriginal School is a modern, well resourced and aesthetically appealing school located amongst natural bushland and adjacent wetlands in Glen Iris, Bunbury. The buildings are unique and designed with Aboriginal perspectives in mind. The school provides a balanced education in a caring, supportive environment. The school curriculum and programs offered support the development of the academic, social, emotional and physical aspects of the whole child, working collaboratively with families to help their child to reach their full potential. At Djidi we cater for individual learning styles, set high standards and have a strong belief that all children can learn. The school believes in and fosters tolerance, diversity and working collaboratively. The promotion of Aboriginal language and culture in assisting Aboriginal children to accept and value themselves and their culture is central to the learning program

Djidi Djidi caters for all children from kindergarten to year 7. The school is based on valuing diversity and inclusivity. We strive to ensure that all students develop an awareness and pride in their own culture whilst applying their knowledge, understandings, skills and attitudes to achieve their individual potential, thereby enabling them to participate fully in the school and wider community. The three key elements that guides the way we work are Stronger, Smarter and Safer.

Learning is developmental. The children are encouraged to be independent learners, with clear expectations and boundaries and are encouraged to be critical and reflective learners. The school works as a whole team with an expectation of commitment to improving outcomes for children and working within the school ethos. Children are encouraged and guided to make choices and be accountable for their decisions.

Connecting our families with the school community, promoting a sense of shared responsibility and building everyone's capacity to work together is vital to ensure that our students have the best chance of realising their social and academic potential.

Djidi Djidi is employing an integrated approach to bring together community services and agencies to support our families and achieve our school goals. We believe that achievement of these goals can be supported through school based health clinics, youth service programs, parent education and other services to improve access to health and social services. Our aim is to address significant gaps in the students' health, social & academic skills with early intervention to support child readiness to commence formal schooling being a priority. Our focus is to affect a cultural shift within our school community through the provision of positive high-quality early childhood experiences, consistent, explicit instruction using evidence-based programs and wrap-around support to families.

The School is fortunate to have an active School Council. The School Council comprises of up to 9 parent-community representatives plus the Principal and two staff members. This group is responsible for helping set the school policies, directions and other areas relating to Aboriginal Culture.

Our school vision states that we are relentless in our approach to creating a culture of excellence for staff, students and our community where our school is anchored by high expectations.

All primary aged children within the Bunbury area can enrol at Djidi Djidi. We welcome new families both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.

The main aims of Djidi Djidi Aboriginal School are:

* to improve educational outcomes for Aboriginal students;
* to strengthen and affirm Aboriginal culture;
* to increase student attendance, retention and engagement at school; and
* to involve Aboriginal community members in school decision making and in the student's educational programs.

Djugerari Remote Community School,5098,"



Djugerari Remote Community School is located 110km south east of Fitzroy Crossing. Nestled in amongst the stunning red hills of the St George Ranges, our school is an integral part of the community.

Our vision is to provide a safe, caring and inclusive learning environment that meets the needs of each individual. Students have the capabilities to contribute to community, are proud of their culture and strive to reach their full academic potential.

We are an active member of the Kimberley Schools Project and our staff are trained in and deliver targeted learning in Literacy and Maths. We can demonstrate significant progress in the learning skills of the students who attend regularly.

Enrolments fluctuate between seven and 14 students and due to the community's remote location, the school experiences high levels of student transiency. The school offers education from Kindergarten to Year 6, where the West Australian Curriculum is used to plan, assess and report on student learning. Our classroom structure allows for highly targeted and developmentally appropriate teaching, with a lower primary class (Kindergarten to Year 2) and an upper primary class (Year 3 to 6). All students speak Kriol as their first language, Walmajarri as their traditional language and Standard Australian English as an additional language.

Although Djugerari Remote Community School is small, the facilities are contemporary and well maintained. The two classrooms have interactive whiteboards, Wi-Fi, 1:1 iPad ratio, sound field systems and new furniture that support flexible classroom structures. There is also a library, an additional classroom that has been converted into a kitchen and 0-3 Room, an undercover basketball court and an office that has a Cell-Fi device enabling 3G mobile coverage within the school.

There are only 16 houses in Djugerari Community and everyone is required to travel to Fitzroy Crossing to access a range of facilities and services as there are no shops, mail or banks available in the community. However, the Royal Flying Doctors visit once a month to provide medical support. We have a friendly collaborative community and the children are characterised by their friendly welcome for visitors to the school.

Donnybrook District High School,4074,"

Donnybrook District High School is a combined school (Kindergarten - Year 10) situated on two sites that lie 1.5 kilometres apart. Donnybrook District High School services the communities of Donnybrook, Kirup and Balingup.

The Junior Campus at Mead Street caters for Kindergarten to Year 6, while the Senior Campus at Bentley Street has a country garden feel and caters for Year 7 to Year 10. In recent years there has been a concerted effort, to strengthen the links between both campuses by an increasing focus on sharing staff and facilities and combining for whole school events. This has been particularly successful and well received by the Donnybrook school community.

District High Schools are truly distinctive learning environments that have the potential to offer both Primary and Secondary students an array of opportunities that develop them academically, socially and emotionally.

All Primary students (Yr 1-6) currently have access to Computing, Physical Education and Music teachers, which complement the teaching and learning delivered by their classroom teachers. The Year 5/6 students also attend an Options Program at the Senior Campus that provides them with access to Art, Physical Education, Design and Technology and Technology and Enterprise specialists and facilities. The Year 3-4 students also have access to a Secondary Art specialist. Over the past two years, we have also been fortunate to provide Science to Upper Primary students from a Science specialist.

The Year 7/8 students have access to specialist teachers in the core and non-core learning areas. For a small Secondary school, Donnybrook District High School is proud to offer these students Physical Education, Woodwork, Metalwork, Art, Food, Textiles, Information Communication Technologies and Library. The Year 9/10 students also have access to specialist teachers in the core and non-core learning areas, with the further option to undertake a Certificate 1 Course in Business, Hospitality, Metals and Engineering, Sport and Recreation or Horticulture.

School community partnerships are integral to the success of the school and are therefore a central focus of the school. Donnybrook District High School has established strong links with businesses within the local and broader communities that are enhancing the schools' programs and creating opportunities that are available to the students. The P&C has been reinvigorated through the commitment of new parents and carers. These parents and carers have vested significantly in supporting the school, its programs and the direction it is heading.

Donnybrook District High School has established a School Board that is committed to actively supporting the Leadership Team to improve student learning. In addition to their participation in planning, reviewing and monitoring school improvement, they have engaged superbly with the school's Business Plan and priority areas. Through the adoption of a 'portfolio' approach, they are valuable contributors to the strategies that are supporting our targets and milestones.

In 2017, we intend to further capitalise on our context to make certain the students are benefiting immensely from an education at a District High School. As a combined school we have a great deal to offer. We are going to be bold, creative and flexible in our decision-making. Making the most of our Independent Public School status!

With the local community at the heart of the school, we have developed positive, mutually respectful partnerships with parents. The sense of ownership within our community is strong, with many generations of our current families having attended our school, which has helped to establish an ethos of being a warm, caring and supportive community.

Highly competent and experienced staff ensure children are given every opportunity to develop their skills. One of our teachers is a National Excellence in Teaching Award winner and another is Getting It Right Numeracy trained. The talents of these teachers are utilised throughout the school.

Our staff are committed to meeting the needs of individual children and offer a very personalised educational program where children at educational risk are effectively targeted and well supported. iPads and computers are utilised to ensure all students progress at their level and become confident, independent learners. Indonesian is offered as a specialist learning area.

Our gardener has also won several awards including the 2009 WA School Support Staff Member of the Year Award in the WA Education Awards, and our cleaner was also a WA School Services Staff Member of the Year finalist in the 2015 WA Education Awards.

Our school prides itself on its high level of sustainability and environmental awareness with our vegetable garden, fruit trees and chook run. This allows us to teach children to be self-sustaining nurturers of the land. Through a partnership with the Forest Heritage Centre in town, we are able to access arts and environmental awareness programs that benefit children.

We also strive to develop attitudes and values which best equip students for a successful life both academically and emotionally. As part of our pastoral care, we employ a Chaplain two days a week who runs programs such as 'Build Up Zone' and 'Choose Respect' in the school. These programs support positive interactions among our children and develop each child's self-worth.

The high level of community involvement develops civic pride and responsibility. This year we received National Quality Standards verification. One comment from our report states: 'Nurturing, respectful relationships with children are the foundation of the classes of the school. This supports the development of a strong sense of well-being'.

Dwellingup Primary School is well resourced with classrooms, a library, undercover area and administrative block. Our school also offers an onsite Playgroup, supporting the education of the younger members of the community.

Our school grounds provide a relaxed and beautiful atmosphere which engenders much talk by visitors. The grounds incorporate a beautiful garden, murals, music and art installations. Last year a nature-based playground was installed, along with new playground equipment. We have a block of bushland, the Karrak Community Nature Trail, adjoining our school. The renowned Bibbulmum Track borders the school.

A number of children are drawn from properties some distance from the town site, and a bus service along the Pinjarra-Williams Road provides transport for these families.

Parents are actively involved with the school through the School Council, P & C Association and the provision of practical help. Parents and community representatives are involved in the decision-making processes through the School Council. The school organises the Giant Pumpkin Festival which attracts over 5000 visitors to the town and raises significant funds for the school.

The Dwellingup Crier, the school's fortnightly newsletter, helps to make sure parents are aware of activities and community events. Regular assemblies, interviews, portfolios and written reports provide parents with feedback about student performance.

The school motto 'Standing Tall and Proud', encapsulates our values of growth, the pursuit of excellence and pride.

West Coast Language Development Centre,6045,"

The West Coast Language Development Centre is a specialist Education Support facility that also includes the Statewide Speech and Language Service (Outreach) for the North Metropolitan (coastal schools) and the MidWest Educational Regions. The centre is located over four sites.

The West Coast Language Development Centre is a centre of excellence that provides specialist early direct intervention (for students), outreach (for schools and networks) and research and development services in the area of speech, language and associated literacy. The synergism and cohesion among service delivery, teaching and research leads to changes in classroom practice as knowledge increases, 'best practices' are identified, and service needs are recognised within the centre and across mainstream schools.

The West Coast Language Development Centre works at the system, network, individual school, leadership, teacher and student level to provide high quality services in speech, language and associated learning that are based on current best practice evidence. The services build on each other and include:

1.Direct services for students: intensive, early intervention
An early, intensive intervention service for kindergarten to year 1 targets students with identified Specific (Primary) Language Impairment in the metropolitan area. High quality assessment, teaching and learning informs and is informed by research and evidence. Teacher leaders and support staff (including speech pathologists) empower and build the capacity of teachers so that they are results orientated and transformational leaders in their own classroom.

2.Outreach
This service responds to the distinctive needs of public primary schools with a focus on improving speaking, listening and literacy learning for students with language difficulties, difference and disorders. The emphasis is on sustainable capacity building of teacher, school and system to deliver high quality learning opportunities.

3.Research and development
The service conducts and supports the research, development and trialling of evidence based practices for speech, language and associated literacy by establishing collaborative partnerships with schools and universities.

Early intervention, outreach, and research & development services of the West Coast Language Development Centre engage in the provision of high quality, differentiated, flexible, practical support to schools and their communities to develop practices and programs that accelerate and maximise learning outcomes for students with speech, language and associated literacy needs. This is underpinned by the moral imperative that all students can learn, including students with language difficulties, delays, disorders or impairments.

The West Coast Language Centre Services works in partnership with the North East Language Development Centre to provide an integrated cohesive approach to speech and language services in the North Metropolitan Educational Region. North East and West Coast also work with Language Centres from the South Metropolitan Region to provide integrated State-wide Services in Speech and Language across the state.

East Kimberley College is one of the largest K-12 schools in the State with approximately 1100 students enrolled. With almost 52% of enrolments being indigenous, it also has the largest enrolment of Aboriginal students of any school in the State.

The College offers all that one would expect in a larger metropolitan school, yet has that unique friendly atmosphere typical of a rural community. Our College strives to ensure all students, regardless of ability or style of learning, are provided with the opportunity to reach their full potential in a positive, supportive and engaging learning environment. We foster individual student interests, encourage active participation in the learning process, and assist students to develop their ability to apply knowledge and skills to real life experiences and challenges.
Our expectations are high and we do not wavier from those expectations as this has the potential to comprise the quality of education we provide to our students. A quality, robust, needs driven educational program which is challenging for students is delivered. A happy, welcoming environment with high quality teaching and learning experiences and quality resources exists, with positive behaviour an underlying fundamental to success.

At East Kimberley College our belief is that 'every student matters every day' and we foster our values through a recognised and respected ethos, 'Seek Strive Believe, Achieve'.
Community confidence is a significant component of being a recognised and respected educational institution, a testament to our ability to deliver upon our promise to be 'the school of choice'. Together we achieve focused academic goals, along with social and emotional growth for our students.

Our College values its strong partnerships with the parent and wider community and has an extremely active and supportive Parents and Citizens Association and School Council.

Approximately 150 staff are employed at the College, 80 as teachers with the balance in non-teaching support roles, including Education Assistants and Aboriginal and Islander Education Officers. Maintaining positive attendance at the school is a constant challenge and in support of this, a number of non-teaching staff are involved in assisting students to attend school and to remain engaged. Also assisting with this are multiple Aboriginal programs, including the Clontarf Football Academy, Role Models Girls Academy, and the Polly Farmer Foundation Follow the Dream Program for aspirant Aboriginal students. All of these organisations are located on site and proactively working with and in support of our students. We also partner closely with local Aboriginal corporations, Miriwoong Gajerrong Corporation, Wunan Foundation and Waringarri Aboriginal Corporation, to ensure education and school attendance is recognised as a priority in our community.

The College is located on a large, well-maintained and attractive site in the centre of Kununurra. The school draws from a diverse town population representing Aboriginal communities, agricultural, horticultural, mining and related service industries. An extensive range of State and Commonwealth agencies are represented in Kununurra and they work closely with the school to ensure the best support is available for our students.

In 2013 the College enjoyed a $50 million building upgrade, through the East Kimberley Development Package, providing students and staff with contemporary facilities in which to work and learn. At the completion of the construction work, Explicit Instruction as the principal pedagogical approach was introduced across all year levels.
East Kimberley College is proud of its extremely successful Senior School program and has achieved excellent Year 12 results for consecutive years. The 2018 Year 12 cohort included two students entering the most prestigious 99 Club.

We provide each child with opportunities, through individual education programs and small group teaching, to maximise the development of physical well-being, positive responsible attitudes and skills for life-long learning.

Our school caters for approximately 21 children from kindergarten to Year 6 with intellectual and/or physical disabilities. An enthusiastic team of teachers and Education Assistants are specifically trained to support our students. They are committed to providing children with a quality education in a safe, inclusive learning environment.

We have an academic focus, using structured programs which effectively support students with learning difficulties. Each student has an Individual Education Plan which is reviewed regularly. These plans are formulated in consultation with the parents, teachers and therapists and recognise the child's individuality. Children are encouraged to understand the values of respect, environmental responsibility, citizenship and self-regulation.

We work closely with East Victoria Park Primary School and encourage integration wherever possible. This applies to both the ESC and the Primary school, with students integrating onto both sites. This inclusive approach between both schools provides a rich variety of learning opportunities.

In 2017, we added an early learning classroom catering for children from kindergarten and pre-primary. The focus is on developmental play, language and communication skills and is staffed by an Early Childhood trained teacher. Already we have seen gains in communication and socialisation among students in the class.

Some of the special programs that we run are:

Community Access Program (CAP): designed to provide opportunities for our students to practice and develop social and life skills learned at school. The students are involved in outings which involve shopping, catching buses and trains, purchasing food and visiting community facilities.

Cooking: weekly sessions provide opportunities to cook healthy foods and learn about nutrition.

Treatment and education of autistic and related communication of handicapped children (TEACCH): a structured program which is used internationally for students with autism and communication difficulties.

Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS): used also to facilitate communication skills in children with autism and communication difficulties. Visual cues are important for all of our students with PECS being used in conjunction with key word signing.

Perceptual Motor Programme (PMP): runs three times a week for all students. Positive gains have been noticed in regards to students physical strength and coordination.

Specialist Music program: based on the Kids'n'Music program which incorporates speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.

Self care: students learn about caring for themselves independently.

A globe of the world was adopted as the school logo in 1962 to relate to the school motto of 'a fair view of all things'. As we move onward into the 21st Century, the school community has re-examined the culture and purpose of the school. A motto of CARE based on the virtues of Cooperation, Achievement, Respect and Enthusiasm was developed in 2005 and embedded through the Virtues Project in 2006.

Falls Road Primary School,5622,"



Falls Road Primary opened in 1981, is an Independent Public School that prides itself on working closely with parents and the community to provide a high quality education that develops resilient, respectful and lifelong learners.

Our school focuses on developing the 'whole child' through exposure to academic, artistic, social and sporting experiences that provide all students with the opportunity to 'shine' and enable them to participate as informed active and responsible members of society.

Our caring, dedicated staff provide a robust curriculum, quality programs, and extra-curricular activities for students, including lessons delivered by specialist teachers in Art, Music, Italian and Physical Education. Our music program includes a school choir and instrumental tuition for selected students. The school provides a safe and supportive learning environment for students and welcomes parent involvement in school-based programs.

In 2017 Falls Road Primary School was identified as one of the high gain schools across Australia (in the top 20 in WA) that achieved substantially above the expected gain from Year 3 to Year 5 in the 2016 National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) results. This is a reflection on the effectiveness of the programs, the strategies we have and also the quality of the teachers and support staff at Falls Road.
To continue maintaining these standards, we use a range of strategies including our Whole School English and Maths Plans which ensure connectedness across the year levels; our targeted Intensive Reading Program for Year 3 - Year 6 students; and our small group support programs for students across the school.

In 2018, a continued focus on Reading Comprehension skills and the Writing Process through the '7 Steps to Writing Success' and Talk for Writing will ensure ongoing development in these key literacy areas.

We will continue to build on and develop students' Science, Technology, English and Maths (STEM) skills through the use of a range of hands-on, engaging and relevant resources. This has been enhanced through the completion of a separate STEM classroom funded by the school and the P&C in a joint partnership. In ICT, students have access to a lab of computers as well as a mini-lab of laptops that are used for a variety of tasks. There are pods of iPads for class use and every classroom has an interactive whiteboard or touch panel. Digital technology skills are enhanced through exposure to and use of a range of different coding resources including robots (Bee-bots, Spheros, Edison robots), on-line programs and investigations as well as a focus on developing students digital keyboard skills.

Falls Road Primary Independent Public School has developed a fantastic team of teaching and non-teaching staff who are committed to achieving and maintaining our high standards of student achievement and identifying effective ways of adding value to programs already in place. We do this through a comprehensive yearly schedule of student assessment in Reading comprehension, Maths, Spelling and Writing and tracking of student achievement from Pre Primary to Year 6.

This is underpinned by a detailed analysis of student data including our NAPLAN tests. Our ability to monitor student achievement will be greatly enhanced through the implementation of 'Datahub' a program that allows us to collate all student assessment results and view them individually, in groups, cohorts and as a whole school in different curriculum areas.

We have been fine tuning this program and it has assisted us in developing benchmarks that we will use to determine the degree of student progress.

This analysis identified a decrease in student achievement. The research identified that schools using the Explicit Teaching Approach were achieving significantly higher results (ie in NAPLAN). This approach improves the transference of learning from short term memory into long term memory.

We have committed to a phased integration of this approach throughout the school, commencing in 2020. The goal is to improve student learning and achievement, particularly in English and Mathematics across Kindergarten to Year 6.

Early intervention strategies are central to the philosophy of the school and are recognised as a cornerstone in developing and fostering life-long learning skills and habits. We have a partnership with Edith Cowan University (ECU) whereby final year Speech Pathology students screen all Kindergarten students, then develop and assist in implementing tailored intervention plans for identified students. The ECU students continue the targeted interventions into Pre-Primary and Year 1 and Year 2 where required.

Falls Road Primary School acknowledges that students learn at different rates and in different ways. We have built a reputation as a responsive and engaging school where parents are seen as partners in the educational process and we work proactively to ensure this is maintained. This has been recognised and acknowledged in both previous IPS External Reviews of the school in 2013 and 2016.

The school is supported through a strong and active partnership with the Parents and Citizens Association and the School Board. Parents are regularly and positively engaged in a range of activities across the school.

We have a range of proactive strategies in place to ensure regular attendance across all year levels and our attendance is consistently higher than the state average.
Our school motto is 'Challenge the Present - Create the Future' and we will continue to do this through a range of innovative and engaging programs and a committed group of teaching and non-teaching personnel.

Cared for and respected. Challenged and supported. That's our commitment to your children.

A positive sense of self is extremely important, which is why students' wellbeing always comes first. We work on the understanding that students who feel happy, safe and a part of the community enjoy coming to school - and this leads to positive results in the classroom.

Everyone at our school - from the principal to the officer at the front desk - takes on this responsibility by building relationships with children and their parents from their very first visit to our school.

We support students to build sound social skills and achieve academic goals. They have opportunities to apply what they learn to real life situations, and our dedicated teachers put an incredible amount of effort and creativity into the experiences they organise for their classes. These have included publishing a magazine, pitching a new board game, running a cupcake stall, designing play equipment for pet mice and growing vegetables for cooking lessons. Projects like these get students excited about coming to school. Coding apps on school iPads and interactive touch-typing lessons further prepare students for life in the twenty-first century.
Our students take pride in their work, feel confident being themselves and building resilience and lasting friendships. We cultivate connections in our local community so students can make meaningful contributions to society through civic engagement and social action.

Working alongside Living Landscapes and Friends of Forrestdale, teachers take advantage of our proximity to Forrestdale Lake to instil in students a sense of responsibility in caring for the local bushland and native wildlife. Students are also involved in Dale Fest, Kelmscott Show, Forrestdale Little Athletics and Cloud 9 Club - a group that was born here at our school. Club members practise acts of kindness in and around the school including visiting the local aged care facility, distributing handmade cards and gifts, and donating fuel and grocery vouchers to young families in the area.

We regularly invite parents to give us feedback throughout the year so we can improve. Our students and staff love our little school - and so do our parents.

Geographe Primary School sees itself as a school of the future, because that is our role and focus: preparing our students for the future. Everything we do has this in mind.

Our Vision is 'Toward Future Horizons', and currently our mantra is 'Every Child, Every Day - ensuring all children's brains are working, and all children are challenged.'

So what does this mean our students might be doing? In their classrooms, they will be learning in groups or individually, depending on what the subject is and sometimes, where they choose to sit, stand or even lay! Our classrooms look a little different as we incorporate Flexible Learning Spaces, designed to allow students some choice in how and where they learn. At times however they will be working as a whole-class group, because we have a balance of explicit (formal or directed) and student-centred (more open or informal) learning.

They might be learning about the parts of the human brain, how it functions, and how to care for the brain and help its development. In Year 2 and Year 5, they will even cut up a real brain (A sheep's brain, not a human one!).

They might be sitting with their class in a circle, taking part in a philosophy community of inquiry, part of the Geo Way whole-school approach.

They may be in one of our specialist classrooms, learning music, visual art or science and technology with our experienced and skilled specialist staff, or outside in a physical education lesson.

They may be working with one of the class sets of iPads or Macbooks provided by the P&C, perhaps on-line, or producing their work in another medium such as a construction, model, diagram or just an old-fashioned exercise book.

At times, they may leave their classroom for a short while to attend one of our Intervention programs (Speech, 'Zoom' literacy, Maqlit or Maths Mastery if relevant); or one of our half-day programs for Gifted and Talented and High Achiever (which we call GATHA) students.

In the playground, they may be playing at one of our several play equipment stations, digging in a sandpit, running around the oval, riding a bike around our BMX bike track, or sitting at one of our covered outdoor seating units taking with friends.

Whether they are inside or outside, they will from time to time receive a reward token, or just a positive comment, from a staff member who has acknowledged them doing the right thing and demonstrating one of our four expectations: Be a Learner, Be Respectful, Be Safe, Be Caring.

The tokens can be placed in the draw for a prize such as Pizza with the Principal, extra recess time for his/her class, or a canteen voucher. Everyone cares for and about each other at Geographe. The agreed expectations are clear, it is rare to see an example of someone behaving otherwise.

Geographe Primary School is an exciting place. Visitors often remark on how positive the place feels, and how happy and friendly everyone, including students and staff, appear to be.

Everything we do has as its guiding principle, preparing our students for the future, beyond primary school. At the same time, we like to have some fun and enjoy our successes.

Geraldton Primary School is Western Australia's oldest continuously operating primary school, with students first attending in 1878. The school is heritage-listed and will be turning 140 in 2018.

We have a long established and excellent reputation in the Geraldton community, attracting students from all parts of the city and outlying regions.

We are very proud of our school motto, 'Generosity, Perseverance and Service', ensuring we display these qualities as we go about our daily work at school.

The school prides itself on its personal approach to families and pastoral care programs. We cater for both the needs of individual students as well as the education of all our students. We actively seek and build partnerships with agencies and the local community to provide high quality educational opportunities for every student. Additionally, the school has an in-school Chaplain and a School Psychologist who provide support to students, staff and the school community.

Our students come from a range of cultural backgrounds which greatly enhances our school community. We have strong links with the parents/carers of our students. They are motivated and keen for their children to succeed and provide great support to them, the school and staff.

Our staff members have considerable teaching experience and commitment to their roles which leads to a very stable, quality learning environment. They are continually working to improve their professional practice, focussing recently on the role of digital technologies and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and how this can enhance both student achievement and teachers' own professional practices.

We have a large offsite Kindergarten which is equipped for 40 students.

The main school has 13 classrooms, a designated art/science room, multi-purpose library resource centre, two Pre-primary rooms, Computer Lab and Music room. Technology resources include wireless network, laptops, iPads, Apple TVs and electronic whiteboards for each classroom.

An Indonesian Language program from Kindergarten to Year 6 is provided, as is Physical Education, STEM and Music programs by 3 Specialist Teachers. The school runs several choirs: Senior, and both Junior Girls and Boys Choir and a highlight of each assembly is the community song which is enjoyed by all students, staff and members of the school community.

The SIMS (School of Instrumental Music) teachers also provide lessons for Year 5 and 6 students selected in this program in Guitar, Brass and Woodwind. These students can then also become part of the John Willcock College Combined Band.

Selected Year 4 students also are provided an opportunity to be part of the academic extension program PEAC (Primary Extension and Challenge).

Year 6 students attend a school camp each year to Coral Bay which is a highlight and much looked forward to event.

Our School Council members are a valuable asset to the school. In collaboration with the school, they led the Fathering Project initiative of an overnight campout on the school oval for 40 fathers and father figures and their children. It was a wonderful success.

The P&C Association is a major contributor to the school and over the years has been responsible for a range of improvements at Geraldton Primary including air conditioning, playground equipment, gates and shade. The P&C has also funded the purchase of a sea container for Loose Parts play purposes for all Year 1 to 6 students with the focus on creativity.

An undercover activity area is used for assemblies, physical education lessons and a play area. We are lucky enough to also have a large indoor hall which is used for range of learning activities. The school has large grassed open spaces used by the students for play, outdoor lessons and Physical Education lessons.

We promote positive behaviour by embedding our values of 'Respect, Responsibility and Doing Your Best' in all activities, whether in or out of the classroom.

Gidgegannup is a thriving community with diverse interests, magnificent scenery and a wonderful lifestyle. The town-site provides a focus for potential growth in the north-eastern hills. A church has also been built by the community and there is a fire station supported by volunteer fire brigades. There is a small shopping centre and a newsagency, operating as a post office.

West Coast Language Development Centre,6045,"

The West Coast Language Development Centre is a specialist Education Support facility that also includes the Statewide Speech and Language Service (Outreach) for the North Metropolitan (coastal schools) and the MidWest Educational Regions. The centre is located over four sites.

The West Coast Language Development Centre is a centre of excellence that provides specialist early direct intervention (for students), outreach (for schools and networks) and research and development services in the area of speech, language and associated literacy. The synergism and cohesion among service delivery, teaching and research leads to changes in classroom practice as knowledge increases, 'best practices' are identified, and service needs are recognised within the centre and across mainstream schools.

The West Coast Language Development Centre works at the system, network, individual school, leadership, teacher and student level to provide high quality services in speech, language and associated learning that are based on current best practice evidence. The services build on each other and include:

1.Direct services for students: intensive, early intervention
An early, intensive intervention service for kindergarten to year 1 targets students with identified Specific (Primary) Language Impairment in the metropolitan area. High quality assessment, teaching and learning informs and is informed by research and evidence. Teacher leaders and support staff (including speech pathologists) empower and build the capacity of teachers so that they are results orientated and transformational leaders in their own classroom.

2.Outreach
This service responds to the distinctive needs of public primary schools with a focus on improving speaking, listening and literacy learning for students with language difficulties, difference and disorders. The emphasis is on sustainable capacity building of teacher, school and system to deliver high quality learning opportunities.

3.Research and development
The service conducts and supports the research, development and trialling of evidence based practices for speech, language and associated literacy by establishing collaborative partnerships with schools and universities.

Early intervention, outreach, and research & development services of the West Coast Language Development Centre engage in the provision of high quality, differentiated, flexible, practical support to schools and their communities to develop practices and programs that accelerate and maximise learning outcomes for students with speech, language and associated literacy needs. This is underpinned by the moral imperative that all students can learn, including students with language difficulties, delays, disorders or impairments.

The West Coast Language Centre Services works in partnership with the North East Language Development Centre to provide an integrated cohesive approach to speech and language services in the North Metropolitan Educational Region. North East and West Coast also work with Language Centres from the South Metropolitan Region to provide integrated State-wide Services in Speech and Language across the state.

Harrisdale Primary School is proudly an Independent Public School with an impressive reputation for high expectations, high standards, and high quality learning programs. We strive to ensure that every child is successful, known, valued and cared for. We pride ourselves on putting 'students and learning at the centre of all that we do'.

Our high quality, caring and dedicated teachers and staff are always continually developing their knowledge, understanding and skills, making sure that best evidenced-based teaching practices are used.

Fundamental in a child's education, is the building of strong foundations in literacy and numeracy from an early age. We prioritise early childhood education and ensure the explicit teaching of literacy and numeracy skills and understandings.

We aim to develop highly engaged children with the skills to live and work in a rapidly changing world. Central to this is ensuring your child gains the right skills - critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, creativity, communication and citizenship. We purposefully encourage and embed these skills into our learning programs.

Our highly skilled teachers tailor learning programs to suit each child's needs. They provide appropriate intervention strategies for those requiring additional support, as well as challenging and stimulating children who are academically talented (for example, our Academic Extension Program for children in Years 3 to 6). Specialist programs taught by qualified teachers include music (including the Instrumental Music Program), French, visual arts, physical education and junior science (for children up to Year 2).

Enriching pastoral care programs and clubs run before and after school. These include senior choir, concert band, gardening club, basketball club, code club, STEM club, boys' and girls' clubs, French club and arts splash.

How we interact with one another and how we conduct ourselves is guided by our Positive Behaviour Support values and behaviour expectations of Respect, Resilience, Excellence, Safety and Responsibility. We encourage a growth mindset and goal-setting to ensure that every child learns in an environment that is happy, safe and supportive.

We are leaders in digital technologies and support other schools in these areas. We have a BYO iPad program in Years 3 to 6, and a large selection of technologies to enhance and engage learning.

Our school values and prioritises positive partnerships and community involvement with our parents, families and wider community. All are welcome members of our Harrisdale family and play a vital and active part in our P&C Association and School Board, as well as volunteering at school events.

Our school has state-of-the art facilities, with every classroom boasting current technologies. We also have a STEM maker space and purpose-built science room and will soon have a recording studio. Playground facilities include a combination of manufactured equipment and natural play environments that challenge children to explore and test their capabilities in a safe, fun and challenging way.

Cocos Islands District High School,4157,"

Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School is without doubt one of the most unique educational environments in Australia. Situated on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands it is the most westerly of Australia's territories, lying in the Indian Ocean approximately 2900 kilometres northwest of Perth and 2600 kilometres west of Darwin. Its nearest neighbour is Christmas Island situated 900 kilometres to the northeast.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School is a Commonwealth School that is operated by agreement between the Commonwealth and State Governments. This agreement allows the Department of Education to deliver education programs to students at Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School in a manner that is similar to those delivered in comparable mainland Western Australian communities

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands are made up of 27 small islands that form a horseshoe shaped atoll around a central lagoon, which is 8 kilometres wide. The total area of these islands is 14 square kilometres; the majority of this is taken up by West Island and Home Island. These two islands house a population of approximately 550 adults and children with the remaining islands being unpopulated. The population is made up of 90 mainland Australians that provide administration and other services to the Islands, with the remaining population being Australians of Cocos Malay descent living on Home Island. Since the 'Act of Self Determination' in 1984, a whole-island decision to integrate as an Australian Territory, the islands have modernised while maintaining many of the traditions and values associated with the Cocos Malay people and their religion.

Strong student focus and staff collaboration are the cornerstones of education at Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School. This platform enables the school community to develop a shared vision that encompasses Western Australian Department of Education priorities and enhances professional delivery of a dynamic and appropriate curriculum. Mindful of the unique situation of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the school is committed to the ongoing health and well-being of all, through an inclusive pastoral care culture. This school aims to maintain a vibrant, positive and flexible team who focus their energy in a united direction to achieve agreed targeted outcomes.

Staff have a commitment to ongoing professional development, including annually updated E.S.L. and Surf Lifesaving qualifications, which, given our geographical location, allow us to utilise the natural environment for student activities.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands District High School comprises two campuses. The Home Island campus caters for Home Island Kindergarten to Year 6 students. The West Island campus, operates a Kindergarten to Year 6 primary school for West Island students and also houses the secondary school, Year 7-10. The majority of secondary students travel the 8 kilometres across the lagoon by ferry to and from school each day. At present, students continue their post-compulsory education at mainland schools. Comprehensive careers advice is provided to all students, and is complemented by work experience programmes both on and off-island.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

Fly High, Seek Success is our school motto. To achieve this we are committed to developing individual best through individual challenge by way of a whole-school approach and differentiated curriculum. We are child-centred and focussed upon children's learning and their overall development as productive and positive young Australians.

Children, staff, parents and families are happy to be here and all like coming to our Independent Public School, where courtesy, manners and respect are valued. Visitors to our school, based in the southern suburb of Success, consistently tell us that our school has such a lovely feel and great atmosphere.

Relationships are a key priority at our school. Parents and extended family are keen participants at events and often visit the school to celebrate successes and join in. Friendly relationships and honest communication between staff, students and parents is highly valued.

Day to day social and emotional learning is a major emphasis at Jandakot, supported by the implementation of Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) across all year levels.

From an early start, the development of oral language, motor/movement skills and social skills are an emphasis. With this as our basis, your child will move forward with support and individually targeted challenges.

To prepare your child for a society which is increasingly technological, we have a focus on the use of iPads in the classroom to fully support and extend the classroom learning program. As a result, our students are engaged and use their ICT skills in a purposeful and relevant manner.

Our specialist programs provide children with the opportunities to grow in a range of subjects including physical education, music, Italian (LOTE) and science.

Physical fitness and health is encouraged with children participating in some form of daily physical activity. Our physical education program is enjoyed by all children and each child makes personal gains of which they feel proud.

Our Year 3 to 6 school choir is held in high esteem due to their superb performances at a variety of venues. Year 5 and 6 students are eligible to study musical instruments via the Instrumental Music School Program. Year 1 to 6 students enjoy an excellent Italian language program where the emphasis is on speaking, reading and understanding the language.

The science program emphasises engagement and the development of inquiry skills through 'hands on' science. All of our specialist programs are highly acclaimed, greatly enjoyed and achieve high outcomes.

We have a balance of dedicated longstanding and new staff who know, understand and encourage their students, both individually and as a class, nurturing them and caring for their wellbeing. They plan, monitor and target their students addressing individual and group needs within the classroom setting. Mutual respect, trust and prompt communication are a cornerstone of our school.

Our parent bodies (School Board and P&C) are enthusiastic volunteers who lead and share in the focus of our school motto and philosophy.

We aim to provide experiences and opportunities for students to explore their uniqueness while contributing to a joyful community with a passion for learning. This is echoed in our school motto 'Joy | Pride | Success'.

Our core belief is that being valued as part of a school community, our students are able to create and strengthen positive relationships; develop resilience, social and emotional learning skills; experience learning independence; and become creative, critical and reflective thinkers.

Our teaching staff are experienced, innovative, and enquiring teaching professionals who use their knowledge to support the school culture of learning, engagement and education. Their enthusiasm and strong commitment enable all students to achieve their full potential in a safe and productive environment within the school and the wider community. We strongly believe in collaboration and sharing effective practise within our school and the wider educational and community networks.

As part of a small semi-rural community, we encourage community involvement in school activities; volunteers are an important part of the school community, providing children with practical skills, community engagement, a sense of belonging and opportunities to develop communication skills.

Using the 'Friendly Schools Plus' program we encourage all members of our school community to promote the social and emotional learning skills. We achieve this by promoting personal responsibility, considering consequences and making the right choices.

Taking advantage of our semi-rural location, we incorporate the environment into many of our learning spaces, through our environmental program, Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden and associated cooking activities, outdoor classrooms, and involvement in local activities such as Tree Planting Day, Clean Up Australia, and Ribbons of Blue.

Our webpage proudly displays our current and future events and activities and is a great source of information about our school and community. We'd love to show you our school and tell you more about our community, learning and engagement opportunities, and above all, why Jarrahdale Primary School contributes to a sense of belonging for our students.

Jigalong Remote Community School,5224,"

Jigalong is an Aboriginal community which is located 170 kilometres east of Newman on the edge of The Great Sandy Desert. On the western side of the Rabbit Proof Fence, this is the community in the Pilbara which gained international recognition with the 2002 February release of the film which was given the same name.

The school and its community buildings are nestled in the heart of the community with its day to day operations permeating the broader routines of the Martu People who have maintained strong traditional ties with both their culture and land. Tracing back as far as 20,000 years, the Martu people self-manage the Jigalong community, with the Jigalong School Council providing a community voice which inform both the decisions and operations of this unique remote Indigenous school.

Jigalong Remote Community School, is a level three school with an enrolment of 94 students (75 primary aged students, 21 secondary students). Due to the transient nature of the Martu people, moving between Jigalong, Nulligine, Newman, Punmu, Parngurr and Kunawarritjii, the school population varies from day to day. This unique trait means the school requires teachers of the Jigalong Remote Community School to be both fluent and flexible in their teaching approach. Many who have worked here in the past state the benefits of teaching within such a dynamic and varied educational context. As a result, differentiated practice coupled with explicit instruction, guide the multiaged grouped classes, with many students offered opportunities to progress with wherever they are identified to be academically.

Academic programmes employed focus on improving literacy and numeracy. Programmes like 'Words Their Way' and Diana Rigg's 'Promoting Literacy Development' show incremental methodology for strategically progressing students in their understanding of language and communication. 'Talk for Write' scaffolds help student understanding of different text forms and how to construct and/or respond to them. Numeracy programmes based around problem solving and practicing numeracy for life also assist students to progress in their mathematical understanding.

Life skills, are also a foregrounded distinctive of the school community. This is embedded in both the pre-entry practices in grooming and hygiene; teamwork and sporting initiatives. Swimming lessons and water-based activities further facilitate opportunities for skill acquisition whilst being a deliberate part of the attendance strategy utilised by the classroom teacher. The two week woodwork workshops offered to senior school students contextualises learnt theory whilst offering students the opportunity to employ and demonstrate skills to achieve a TAFE Certificate 2.

Initiatives like the breakfast and lunch programmes form a larger part of the school's role within the community. They also are a part of the school's attendance strategy. Before school sports activities foster student awareness of the broader school community which exists beyond their classroom. Implicitly students learn to engage with one and other whilst seeing the benefit of exercise and fitness through sport like cricket and football. Physical exercise also helps with mental focus as the day begins.

All facets of the school work together to develop the student body to respect themselves and others. The programmes implemented ensure that student strive and focus to achieve their potential.

The development of Joseph Banks Secondary College is an essential component in the delivery of public education in the rapidly expanding suburb of Banksia Grove in the City of Wanneroo.

The first stage of our school can boast a $58 million build. This will be finest public schools in Western Australia and will provide this community with facilities of which to be proud. The facilities will provide the backdrop for an excellent education. Building works for Stage 2 of Joseph Banks Secondary College commences in July 2016.

Given the name of the school and the name of the boulevard on which it is situated (Joseph Banks) a vision based on discovery through learning, and a school focussed on specialist programs like science and mathematics is appropriate. Other specialist programs will complement these. The community focus will be vital in helping to shape such programs, especially in the view that school will share facilities with the community. Joseph Banks was an advocate for settlement in Australia as well as being a renowned naturalist and in his later years his home in London was a centre for the wider scientific community. This notion of partnership and collaboration will underpin the work of Joseph Banks Secondary College.

Students of the school can expect that learning at Joseph Banks Secondary College will be adventurous. Teachers will find ways to ignite curiosity; all the while challenging students to exceed expectations, and everyone will practice education for life.

Jungdranung Remote Community School is located 132km south east of Kununurra in Kija tribal land in the East Kimberley, amidst the spectacular Ragged Range in the Mandangala Community on Glen Hill Station. Opened as a 'Special Aboriginal School' in 1984, the small school is an integral part of the community.

Named after a local elder and defender of the land in the nineteenth century, Jungdranung Remote Community School provides education that focuses on pride, achievement, values and empowerment in a caring and inclusive environment.

Kalamunda Primary Education Support Centre,6052,"



At Kalamunda Primary Education Support Centre (KP ESC) we share our site with Kalamunda Primary School and are surrounded by magnificent Natureplay spaces and bush land. We are a growing, small school for students with disabilities. Initially, our Centre was established in 1985 as a school for children diagnosed with an Intellectual Disability (ID). Today, our enrolment still includes those students with an ID, but also encompasses students with Autism, Global delays and physical disabilities.

Our staff are well trained and experienced in designing and delivering programs that meet the diverse need of our entire student population with each classroom environment implementing the philosophies of TEACCH in structure and routines. We were previously recognised as a Teacher Development School delivering professional learning in the area of 'Structuring your classroom for success: A TEACCH approach'. Our staff are recognised as specialists in creating and teaching students with disabilities in highly structured classroom environments utilising the TEACCH approach.

Approximately one third of our students access the school bus service, provided by the Public Transport Authority (PTA) that offer a free of charge door to door service for students who meet criteria for enrolment and outside of our local area. KP ESC has a wide enrolment catchment, with the closest Education Support facilities being Durham Rd in Bayswater, Sth Ballajura and Maddington. KP ESC also has a number of students from outside of the PTA boundaries that are transported to school by parents based on their belief that KP ESC offers students something more than their local schools can provide.

All KP ESC staff value their relationships with families and work to build and maintain strong channels of communication. In turn, families support us in our endeavour to provide ongoing valuable and appropriate programs for all students and families. In recognition of the fact that many families live outside of the local area and rarely meet, we facilitate regular parent network gatherings in an effort to provide family links and support.

Each KP ESC student has a documented plan that covers the learning areas as prescribed in the WA Curriculum. There is also a determination that students will become independent in managing their daily needs and be responsible for their behaviour. In addition to an academic curriculum, we also offer specialised programs to meet the global educational needs of each and every student.

These programs include but are not limited to:

* Home Economic program
* Social Training program
* Augmented and Assisted Communication (AAC) including Key Word Sign, PECS and the use of AAC devices (both high and low tech is offered)
* Variety of Therapy Programs - both provided privately at the school and in collaboration with the variety of therapy providers (both NDIS and otherwise)
* Community Access Programs (in terms 2 and 3)
* Art specialist
* PE Programs
* LOTE program - Key Word Sign
* School Camps
* 123 Magic - Behaviour Intervention program across home and school (parent trainer on site)
* Behaviour Education

Our staff and families are extremely proud of our school and the educational experiences we provide for each student. We work as a cohesive team within our school and alongside our peers in the Primary School. Lee Bates (Principal of KPS) and Jarna Wright (Principal KP ESC) often refer to the 'our Kalamunda Kids'. Everyone is made to feel welcome when visiting us in this positive and exciting educational environment.

We believe that interested families should always investigate their options, so invite you to contact the Principal, Mrs Jarna Wright and make an appointment to visit.

The spelling was soon changed by the Surveyor General to today's spelling of 'Kalamunda'. The school was moved to Heath road in 1925, where it still stands today. The original schoolhouse was relocated to the Kalamunda History Village and is well worth a visit to see how much our school has changed over the years.

Today Kalamunda Primary School is a vibrant and dynamic school with excellent facilities and staff catering for a bustling hills community made up of varied backgrounds and cultures.

Kalgoorlie School Of The Air,5927,"

Kalgoorlie School of the Air is the largest school in WA by area. The school's catchment area covers 750 000 sq km and most of our students are geographically isolated, living on farms, pastoral stations, roadhouses, remote communities and mining leases. Overcoming the isolation and distance to deliver quality education to our students, is the school's core goal. The base school is located in Boulder, in a charming building that is over 110 years old.

The school was established in 1962, using the Royal Flying Doctor Service aerials and radios, but since 2004 we have utilised digital communications - a computer and satellite solution that makes interactivity possible. In 2016 the school introduced Playgroup (three-year-old) and in 2017 the school said goodbye to the Year 7 student intake. In 2018 we installed a playground for students to use when in Kalgoorlie on camps and in-school visits.

The school has a Principal, Manager Corporate Services, general classroom teachers, a Support Teacher Learning (STL) and support staff, who are dedicated to supporting students, parents and home tutors. The classroom teachers visit students at their homes and provide a mixture of online and written programmes. They also organise four camps during the year and every third year the Year 4 to 6 students visit Canberra. Air lessons are an important part of the teacher-student interaction, and take place via the NBN, each day. The STL staff member, a position unique to the Schools of the Air in WA, supports teachers, students, parents and tutors, with planning, assessment and programming for students with learning difficulties or disabilities.

There is a strong focus on literacy, numeracy, integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools into the curriculum and collaboration with tutors, parents and students. The school seeks feedback from parents, tutors and students regularly, and uses that to drive its review of programmes.

Our students use a variety of ICT tools, including notebook computers, iPads, digital cameras, as well as the Internet and Office tools, email and the Connect portal, to overcome distance and isolation.

The school has several highlights throughout each year:
* Home Tutor Seminar
* Ongoing home visits by teachers
* Camps - Sports Camp, SOTA Muster, Junior Camp, Canberra Camp

Kalumburu Remote Community School,5236,"

Kalumburu - meaning 'Path By The River or River Crossing' is the most northerly Aboriginal Community in Western Australia and is situated on the banks of the King Edward River beside a long, deep billabong at the upriver end of Malindjar Gorge. The nearest townships to Kalumburu are Kununurra (565 kms S.E.), Wyndham (560 kms S.E.) and Derby (650 kms. W) Access to the region is available by sea, air from Kununurra, Wyndham and Derby/Broome and by unsealed road depending on seasonal conditions.

Climate
Kalumburu is situated at latitude 14 degrees south; the climate is Monsoon Tropical with a protracted Dry season and cyclonic Wet season. Rainfall during the Wet is extreme and cyclonic presence inhibits movement around the area. Wet season temperatures range up to 40 degrees Centigrade and humidity is often in the high 80 - 90% level. Dry season temperatures range from 18 degrees through 28 degrees. The Kalumburu Road is closed from November 1st through to April 1st each year, washaways and general road erosion effect access to the region generally until early to mid May of the following year. The community is serviced by an all weather airstrip with night landing facilities.

People
Continuous habitation of the area appears certain for more than 5,000 years with some research suggesting that habitation could have occurred as long ago as 70,000 years. The prominent tribal groupings of the region encompass the Gwini (Kwini) Waanambal, Gambera and Worrora peoples. Family relationships spread from Broome through to Kununurra and relate to the existence of the various Missions of several religious orders set up during the early 1900's at a number of sites.

The Community of Kalumburu currently numbers around 600 people it is serviced by the school, community clinic, community store including takeaway, administration office providing postal, banking and Centrelink services.

Mission
Formerly the 'Drysdale River Mission', Kalumburu Mission was founded in 1908 by Benedictine missionaries from New Norcia. The original settlement was at Pago some 30 kilometres to the North East of present day Kalumburu. Shortage of water to serve the growing numbers of mission staff and aboriginal residents prompted a move to the present site in the period 1932 to 1938. The Kalumburu Mission still plays an active role in the day to day activities of the residents of Kalumburu, running a caf¿, take-away store and fuel services.

School Priorities
Kalumburu has a high percentage of Aboriginal students and the targets are Literacy and Numeracy. From 2005 onwards, the school will be part of the Aboriginal Literacy Strategy that is being established as a state-wide procedure for addressing literacy needs in Aboriginal students. The process seeks to provide a uniform teaching strategy that meets the needs of a highly mobile and transient population of students.

In the early years of education, the school takes part in the Indigenous Language Speaking Students programme. This is a focus on Standard Australian English for use with students who have English as a second language or dialect. Teachers are expected to adopt and use ESL strategies for most of the students throughout the school. We are developing strategies that embody a team approach to lesson delivery.

The school is also focussing on increasing the level of community participation and involvement in the school. We are facilitating the teaching of traditional story, dance and art as well as promoting the use of the Kwini language.

Parents will be familiar with the Individual Education Program (IEP) approach to educational planning and, in this regard, you will find a comfortable familiarity with what happens in your child's primary school or current setting. To this end, you will be assured your child will be immersed in an exceptional learning program delivered and enhanced by well-trained, caring and dedicated staff whose clear focus is ensuring your son or daughter achieves their very best.

The transition into a secondary setting is often a daunting prospect for parents. At Kensington, we work closely with families to make that transition as easy and stress-free as possible. The school is structured so that students aren't expected to change classes on a regular basis. Once assigned a class for the year your child can typically expect to be supported by the same staff in the same room and within the usual routines. Movement away from the home class will happen as a class group to allow access to community-based programs and some specialist programs such as swimming/hydrotherapy, horticulture or physical education.

The school is set in a very picturesque location adding to the calm and welcoming atmosphere. There is plenty of space for your child to spend their breaks and, if required, a safe play area should there be any concern about wandering away during these times. There is a high staff to student ratio at the school ensuring close supervision within classes as well as at break times and on school excursions. These staffing levels also mean that your child will be provided with exceptional support when they commence work experience and work placement in these senior school years.

Being located close to the city allows the school to offer great access to a vast assortment of opportunities for your child. This includes the full range of public transport services, attendance at cultural events, significant training and employment services, as well as a myriad of disability, further education and employment agency supports. The school takes advantage of its location to further enhance your child's learning needs by accessing the community for a number of life skill related activities including shopping, recreation and community service access. Additional programs, such as those provided at Hillside Farm, value add to the school-based curriculum and allow students to have a broader range of experiences that don't restrict their learning to the classroom.

Preparing you and your child for the next stage of their learning can feel almost overwhelming at times. The staff at Kensington Secondary School are understanding and supportive, knowing full well the numerous concerns you might have at this time. They are able to offer sound advice and practical support from having successfully assisted many families through this experience in the past and are happy to sit down and talk with you about what your child's education at Kensington will look, sound and feel like. The support and assistance you need to commence this exciting journey is just a phone call and a visit away.

Kimberley School Of The Air,5928,"

A BRIEF HISTORY:

Kimberley School of the Air (KSOTA) provides educational services to children living in remote and isolated locations across the Kimberley region of WA. The school commenced operations in 1960 at the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) base at the Derby Airport, before eventually transferring to the Derby District High School campus and, in 1981, to it's own building. At this time the school received it's own HF frequency eliminating interruptions to air lessons by RFDS emergencies and general business. The school, rapidly expanding in enrolments and staff, was given a second and third building in 1987 and 1990. A second radio frequency was also added in 1990.

KSOTA moved into a new, purpose designed and built facility in April, 2002 - reflecting the Education Department's commitment to distance education in the Kimberley region of WA. The facility is characterized by high quality, flexible work and learning spaces - with a major focus on cutting edge educational technology.

In July 2004, the RFDS radio network was replaced by a state-of-the-art satellite communication system using the latest in 21st century multi-media communication technology. The SATWEB system links all enrolled students wherever they are across the Kimberley to the school in Derby - and to each other. Students have access to clear voice communication, screened internet services, shared applications and email - bringing the entire world to the remotest locations in the Kimberley.

In 2007 again School of the Air went through a major upgrade and the new CENTRA system was introduced, enabling quicker and clearer air sessions, conferencing and one to one sessions. Centra can be used at any location across not only the state but continent.
Still sharing common grounds with Derby District High School, the school is now one of five Schools of the Air within the Schools of Isolated and Distance Education (SIDE), within the Department of Education and Training.

DEMOGRAPHICS:

Kimberley School of the Air caters for the educational needs of isolated children from pre-school (kindergarten) to Year 7 in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Spread across an area of some 450,000 sq kms, these children live on remote cattle stations, stations now catering to tourism, small Aboriginal communities or out-stations and smaller rural farming blocks. Although the student population varies across the dry and wet seasons of the sub-tropical north, the indigenous student enrolment generally averages between 35 -45 percent of the school population.


PERSONNEL:

KSOTA staff numbers vary according to student numbers, but currently includes the Principal, 6 full time teachers, 1 part time teacher, a part time librarian and school officer and full time registrar.


Daily learning experiences are delivered through a collaborative relationship between teachers and home tutors - usually a mother or caregiver, occasionally a paid governess - who tutor their children through their learning programs. In this form of 'home schooling', teachers provide professional advice to tutors and students, develop and plan curriculum, monitor and assess student progress - and provide all important pastoral care to students and tutors.

Teachers also visit remote home site for these purposes - using 4WD vehicles and chartered light aircraft - and provide extensive support via telephone, email, at camps and on the SATWEB.


LEARNING PROGRAMS:

KSOTA's teachers generally facilitate learning for one or two year levels, or multi-age groups (depending on student numbers) and communicate with students during daily SATWEB lessons for 30-40 minutes per day. The school currently has 3 studios to facilite CENTRA lessons for groups of students or individuals.

Students complete set work developed through WESTONE in Perth in conjunction with extensive school based programs where additional outcomes relating to individual needs are addressed.

In 2007,teachers continued to develop learning materials, resources and community sets based on approaches for our indigenous students, many of whom use standard Australian English as a second language.

DET and/or KSOTA provides each enrolled family with a SATWEB installation (computer, peripherals, printer/scanner/copier, satellite dish and its install etc) and loan arrangements for CD ROM based software, maths equipment, early childhood education resources & equipment, library boxes, sports equipment etc.


HOME TUTOR SEMINAR & CAMPS:

Camps play a major role in the education of our isolated students.

The main school camp, the Home Tutor Seminar, brings together the entire school community including students, teachers, parents and tutors. At this seminar parents and tutors are provided with valuable professional development and training to help them with their teaching role - not to mention lots of networking opportunities. Children also participate in a valuable learning program rich in socialisation opportunities. This event also plays a major role in building our strong sense of community.

Throughout the year the school holds mini camps. These are regional and designed to be at minimal cost for families. The mini camps, often held on larger stations or in a regional town, are a time for students to get together and develop computer skills, team skills in sports, arts, problem solving and project work.

The final camp for the year - the SOTA Muster - coincides with our year 7 graduation ceremony in Derby - afterwhich our year 4-7 children fly south to Perth. This Perth camp is attended by year 4 - 7 students from each of the five Schools of the Air and offers a wide range of learning experiences to students, including visits to museums, science centres, Adventure World, sports development days and personal development programs - allowing our children access to experiences and opportunities otherwise not within their reach.

The senior students also particpate in the Young leaders Conference held in Perth each year, this leadership day suports the contiuned development of encouraging leaders ship the in our school.


COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:

All school families are very active in the education of the children. The school is characterised by partnerships - which is the main ingredient required to make distance education successful for our children.

The school has a very active P&C and ICPA Association (Isolated Children's Parents Association) who, despite their remoteness, never fail to invent innovative ways to develop fund raising enterprises - such as the Annual Halls Creek Picnic Race Meeting & Ball.

The P&C and ICPA hold their meetings on CENTRA as well as face-to-face at the Home Tutor Seminar.

The School Council is also highly active in school affairs - meeting by CENTRA to guide the direction the school takes on key issues - and to assist with community planning.

Fudraising activities are continually held throughout the year across the Kimberley eg: Halls Creek Races, community events and student fundraising.

Our high quality, caring and dedicated teachers and staff are always continually developing their knowledge, understanding and skills, making sure that best evidenced-based teaching practices are used.

Fundamental in a child's education, is the building of strong foundations in literacy and numeracy from an early age. We prioritise early childhood education and ensure the explicit teaching of literacy and numeracy skills and understandings.

We aim to develop highly engaged children with the skills to live and work in a rapidly changing world. Central to this is ensuring your child gains the right skills - critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, creativity, communication and citizenship. We purposefully encourage and embed these skills into our learning programs.

Our highly skilled teachers tailor learning programs to suit each child's needs. They provide appropriate intervention strategies for those requiring additional support, as well as challenging and stimulating children who are academically talented (for example, our Academic Extension Program for children in Years 3 to 6). Specialist programs taught by qualified teachers include music (including the Instrumental Music Program), French, visual arts, physical education and junior science (for children up to Year 2).

Enriching pastoral care programs and clubs run before and after school. These include senior choir, concert band, gardening club, basketball club, code club, STEM club, boys' and girls' clubs, French club and arts splash.

How we interact with one another and how we conduct ourselves is guided by our Positive Behaviour Support values and behaviour expectations of Respect, Resilience, Excellence, Safety and Responsibility. We encourage a growth mindset and goal-setting to ensure that every child learns in an environment that is happy, safe and supportive.

We are leaders in digital technologies and support other schools in these areas. We have a BYO iPad program in Years 3 to 6, and a large selection of technologies to enhance and engage learning.

Our school values and prioritises positive partnerships and community involvement with our parents, families and wider community. All are welcome members of our Harrisdale family and play a vital and active part in our P&C Association and School Board, as well as volunteering at school events.

Our school has state-of-the art facilities, with every classroom boasting current technologies. We also have a STEM maker space and purpose-built science room and will soon have a recording studio. Playground facilities include a combination of manufactured equipment and natural play environments that challenge children to explore and test their capabilities in a safe, fun and challenging way.

Currently the school offers both choir and instrumental programs. Students experience specialised physical education and have the opportunity of participating in a varied sports program. They also study Indonesian through our LOTE program. Kingsley offers pre primary and kindergarten programs. The school focuses on delivering a broad curriculum with an emphasis on Literacy and Numeracy.

The school is engaged in a process of continual improvement so as to build on its perceived strengths. Above all it has a highly experienced and professional staff that have worked together as a team for some time. The staff at Kingsley Primary has embraced the changes that are occurring in relation to contemporary educational practice, and are incorporating these changes into the already successful programs the school has in place. The relative size of the school means that the staff as a whole are aware of the students as individuals, ensuring a caring and understanding approach and tone. Although the rate of movement of children has increased in recent years, the student population is reasonably stable. The parent body is very supportive, assisting the school through an active P and C, School Council and Canteen.

In recent years the school has, based on the demographics of its student population, accessed Commonwealth Government funds that are targeted towards the priority areas of Literacy and Numeracy.

Students at Kingsley Primary School have been very successful in terms of gaining scholarships and entrance into 'specialist programs' in secondary schools. Generally students exit Kingsley to Kelmscott Senior High School, Armadale Senior High School or Cecil Andrews Senior High School. Recently students have achieved entrance into a range of secondary, academic, music, art, athletic, soccer and aviation specialist programs.

In 1999 the school commenced a relationship with the South East Metropolitan Language Development School. An annex of the school was established at Kingsley Primary School to service the needs of students from the south-east metropolitan region. The number of S.E.M.L.D.S. classes at Kingsley Primary School has now risen to four including a pre-primary.

Our mission at Kingston Primary School is to prepare every student with the fundamentals for life success, with the skills to positively contribute to society, and the opportunity to excel.

Kingston has a strong whole-school approach to literacy, numeracy and the Virtues Project which provides students with empowering strategies that inspire the practice of virtues in everyday life. The key virtues that underpin the school's ethos are Care, Courage, Respect and Excellence.

We are honoured to be an Independent Public School catering to our 800 Kindergarten to Year 6 students. Our school is situated 180 km south of Perth in Australind.

The teaching staff bring enthusiasm, commitment and professionalism to the whole school approaches that are embedded in the school and form an exemplary team who work to a common vision. Our vision is to be an innovative exemplar of professional education practice and learning for teachers, and to create optimum developmental opportunities for our students.

There is strong community support for the school, where parents and the local community actively assist in school activities.

A unique feature of Kingston is that it is operated as the only Professional Learning School of its type in Australia. Professional Learning Schools are similar to teaching hospitals in that a number of our classroom teachers are mentors, and have an intern with them throughout the year. Kingston has a strong working relationship with universities around Australia and runs an Internship program where 4th year education students are selected to complete their final year of study at Kingston. Working in a collaborative team, the mentor and intern teacher are able to provide a greater capacity to meet the needs of all students in the class. The aim of this innovative program is to make sure there are highly trained, experienced graduate teachers, committed to teach in a rural setting in WA. Kingston has received state and national recognition for this innovative program and staff have presented it to international audiences in China, South America and the USA.

Kingston Primary school is the only primary school in Australia to be selected to be part of a global technology consortium through the HP Catalyst program. Tablet technology has been implemented throughout the school with a 'BYOD' (Bring Your Own Device) model for Year 3 to 6 students.

The school offers unique programs for all students in music, visual arts, Japanese and physical education. Extension is also offered in these areas.

Part of our commitment to cultural diversity is our Sister School relationship with Takenodai Elementary School in Kobe, Japan. Not only do we teach Japanese language in our school, the two schools engage in a cultural exchange in alternate years. In 2015 and 2017, 20 students travelled to Takenodai and were hosted in Japanese homes. Kingston will host 21 students from Takenodai in 2018.

Before and after school care, as well as vacation care, are located on the school site. We also have a child health clinic and playgroup. An Allied Health Services team will operate from the school in 2018 in an innovative and unique partnership with WA Country Health Services.

Our school has developed a strong, positive reputation and culture validated through external review and annual staff, student and community satisfaction surveys. This information, as well as comprehensive performance and effectiveness data, is analysed by a dynamic school board made up of parents, staff and industry representatives.

A significant event held at the school is the annual ANZAC Dawn Service. The active P&C put on a free community breakfast for over 500 people as we gather to pay our respects at dawn, around the student-developed art installation. The school has won numerous state and national ANZAC awards for its excellence in this area.

We are continually exploring the innovative use of technology and embedding it into our learning and teaching programs. Students who demonstrate sound organisational skills, confidence in their abilities and persistence to achieve their goals provide the catalyst for effective learning. Teachers collaboratively develop school wide approaches to support student achievement in the phases of learning. They deliver an instructional model that builds on new concepts and use regular, consistent reviewing processes to engage students.

Strong, well established partnerships with Kinross College, our local community and the broader community enables us to promote and sustain effective networks. We welcome the input of knowledge and skills by encouraging different perspectives and embracing change to ensure that we not only grow as individuals but also as a whole-school community.

Effective leadership for the present and the future ensures growth is sustained, maintained and evolving. The leadership team supports current practices, keeps abreast of future directions in education and provides the catalyst for ensuring the school adapts to meet the ever-changing needs of today's education priorities. Our leadership structure also supports the growth of future leaders through employing a distributed leadership model that recognises teachers as instructional leaders in their classrooms and future instructional leaders in schools.

Students are encouraged to undertake leadership roles in the school through the Student Forum and Student Council. Both of these promote taking responsibility for specific roles within the school and for providing a student voice for planning and recognising student opinions.

We invite you to grow together with us as we continue to evolve into a school that promotes educational, social, emotional and sustained excellence.

Kirup Primary School,5250,"

Kirup Primary School is a rural school in the town of Kirup, located 55kms from Bunbury on the South West Highway between Donnybrook and Balingup.

Established in 1901, Kirup Primary School is committed to traditional values of learning, community and pastoral care, while embracing new technology, independent learning and critical thinking. The ambience of the school is a talking point for visitors to the school. Our school grounds provide a beautiful, relaxed atmosphere for learning from the outside environment as well as the classroom.

Kirup Primary School provides a comprehensive education for children from Kindergarten to Year 6 in a highly supportive, family-focused environment in which every child counts and where every parent's voice can be heard.

The school is well supported by a school council that works in partnership with the school community, and a very proactive P & C that has been instrumental in providing many resources including an extra classroom for our very young, zero to four-year-old children, who attend our 'Poppets' group at school.

Values and Virtues Education is at the forefront of everything we do and acts as a filter for our interactions with each other and for the decisions about curriculum and school development we make. Our school is well known for its whole school approach to Pastoral Care and the warm caring environment we have created. We pride ourselves on the excellent teacher to student ratio, enabling outstanding attention to individual learning needs, including Gifted and Talent students.

Our school purpose is to provide a stimulating and supportive environment that will facilitate each child's optimum academic, social, creative and emotional development. To achieve this, we focus on the needs of the individual to make sure they develop the understandings, skills and attitudes necessary to fulfil their potential and contribute to society. Our school is a happy school where parents, students and staff enjoy their interactions with one another.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

STUDENTS WHO ARE LITERATE AND NUMERATE AND WHO ARE RESILIENT LIFE LONG LEARNERS.
WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF SELF, OTHERS AND CULTURE AND EMPOWER STUDENTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES SO THAT THEY CAN REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND BECOME RESPECTED MEMBERS OF BOTH THE BIDYADANGA AND WIDER COMMUNITY.

La Grange Remote Community School is situated in the Bidyadanga Aboriginal Community in the Kimberley region on Karajarri country south of Broome and north of Port Hedland.

Bidyadanga is the Karajarri language word for Emu, which means pijarta or bidyada. It means a place where an emu was killed.

The first European thought to have been seen by local Aboriginal people was the French explorer/navigator Baudin who sailed into what is now called La Grange Bay in 1802.

When people from the Nyangumarta, Mangala, Juwaliny and Yulparija country moved from the desert into Bidyadanga the Karajarri people accommodated these people into their country. Community members today still identify as being from one or more of the language groups.

Prior to 1982 a school was run by the the La Grange Mission and in that year the Catholic Bishop of Broome transferred the management of the school to the state government and the school now known as La Grange Remote Community School (RCS) was founded. Some of the buildings used in the time of the mission school are still on the school grounds today.

As the largest Remote Community School in the state, La Grange RCS caters to the educational needs of all school aged children in the Bidyadanga community and classes range from Pre Kindy (2 and 3 year olds)up to Year 12.

The school is broken up into 3 clusters of classrooms with early childhood, middle primary and secondary classes as well as an ICT/Computer laboratory, undercover sports area, a library and fully functioning and purpose built Home Economics, Design and Technology and Music Rooms. All classrooms have Interactive Whiteboards and at least 4 computers per room.

In addition to a strong commitment to developing the literacy and numeracy skills of its students, La Grange RCS offers a diverse range of specialist programs across all year levels including music, art, physical education and information technology.

A priority in the secondary area is Vocational Education and Training with students engaged in TAFE accredited courses delivered by lecturers from Broome each week as well as Aboriginal School Based Traineeships (ASBT's) and a variety of leadership courses run both at school and in Broome.

La Grange RCS excels in sports and takes part in a number of sporting competitions in Broome including football, netball and basketball.

The school is an integral part of the Bidyadanga community and 2 parent groups, the School Advisory Group and the School Council play active roles in the running of the school.

Empowering individuals, developing core values and establishing a life-long learning ethic are our guiding principles at Lancelin Primary School. Our Motto, 'Fly High, See Far' is embedded throughout everything we do and goes hand in hand with our mission, to develop responsible citizens who are successful, confident, creative problem solvers and students who are accountable for their learning.

Everyone at our school takes on this responsibility by building relationships with children and their parents from their very first visit to our school.

We support students to have a passion for learning, built on a foundation of respect of each other, teachers and all significant adults. We explicitly model and teach virtues and values such as resilience, creativity, happiness and respect for all through our 'Cool to be Kind' program. Our students have opportunities to apply what they learn to real-life situations, and our dedicated teachers put incredible effort and creativity into the experiences they organise for their classes.

Our senior students assist with the running of our Breakfast Club, canteen, Monster Fete, create buddy classes with allocated students to enhance transitioning between year groups during recess and lunch times and therefore have opportunities to enhance their leadership capabilities at our school.

Our school is actively engaged with the Jane Goodall Foundation, the Roots and Shoots Foundation and the Perth Zoo. Bill Waterer, who is the WA Roots and Shoots Foundation member, visits our school regularly and inspires our children to become more environmentally aware, especially of endangered and critically endangered animals in the world. Utilising the 'Kitchen Garden Gang' program and the fruit and vegetables we grow in our sustainable garden, students create simple recipes during lessons and lunch times.

Our students work extremely hard to be the best that they can be, to feel confident being themselves and to build lasting friendships. We cultivate connections in our local community so students can make meaningful contributions to society through service and social action.

We cater for children from Kindergarten to Year 6 from the town of Lancelin and the surrounding communities of Seaview Park, Ledge Point, Ocean Farms, Seabird and Redfield Park.

We encourage you to be involved in your child's learning throughout the year, so we are continually improving our support for your child - socially, emotionally and academically. Our students and staff love our little school - and so do our parents.

They also often undertake hygiene programs, plan and cook meals and learn how to take care of personal belongings and pets. The long term goal for our students is for them to undertake successful independent living.

Leda ESC delivers an intensive Early Intervention/Early Childhood program for Kindergarten and Pre Primary students with a diagnosis of Autism and/or Global Development Delay. Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of key conceptual knowledge through an intense Applied Behaviour Analysis program incorporating Discrete Trials Training.

We see ourselves as partners with parents and students to provide a supporting and caring environment during the High School years.

We seek to achieve Harmony and strive for Excellence. Our motto of Harmony and Excellence guides all members of our School Community to rise to their potential and care for each other.

Leeming Senior High School has a school community small enough to be able to care about each individual student but large enough to cater for a very broad range of academic and non-academic needs. Nestled between an abundance of bushland, we enjoy a peaceful environment in which to learn and grow.

It is paramount to us that everyone enjoys their association with our school and that they receive the support to achieve their best in all they do. We consistently receive very positive feedback from parents and students, which is a testament to our commitment.

Our curriculum offers a full range of academic, vocational and creative pathways. Each of the eight learning areas acknowledges the special gifts and interests that our entire student body possess and strive for in their attainment of excellence. We have a team of enthusiastic professionals committed to our student's well-being and enabling them to reach their full potential.

Leeming Senior High School provides extension and enrichment opportunities to students with outstanding academic backgrounds. Students can apply for the Science and Technology Academy or the Japanese Specialist Program, which are two of only 31 Approved Academic and Applied Specialist Programs within the Department of Education. We also offer a School-Based Academic Extension Program in English and HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) for students wishing extension beyond the mainstream curriculum.

All our teaching staff continues to represent their subject areas at various state committees, attend and present at professional development workshops and hold various positions on professional organisations.

The School's support staff includes trained educational assistants and support officers. We all work with one goal in mind - student wellbeing and academic success. We have an active Student Services team that looks after the students' wellbeing in school. It includes Year Coordinators, Careers Advisors, Student at Educational Risk Coordinators, School Psychologist, School Nurse, Chaplain and House Group Teachers.

Our commitment to Harmony and Excellence translates into our Year 12, OLNA and NAPLAN results and the number of students who excel at Interschool, State and National sport Competitions and Cultural Competitions. The high demand for enrolment is testament to the superb learning environment Leeming Senior High School provides to their students.

The School Board, teachers and support staff recognise the importance of helping our students grow an ongoing love of learning and to prepare them to use critical and analytical thinking which will empower them to adapt to this ever-changing world. We are working together to make it happen.

We are located in the Goldfields Education Region, approximately 370 kilometres north of Kalgoorlie. Leinster Community School is an Independent Public School and has undergone rebranding including a new logo, name change from Leinster Primary School and new school uniform. This has been an exciting time, particularly for our students with many more positive changes to come. Our primary school caters for Kindergarten to Year 6. At Leinster Community School we are committed to providing quality education in an inclusive, caring and supportive learning environment.

The school provides a diversity of programs and opportunities for all children within a unique physical environment. We have a strong emphasis on student wellbeing and on developing students' skills in Literacy and Numeracy using current technologies such as iPads and Interactive Whiteboards. Our Kitchen Garden Program commenced in 2013 and all students are actively involved. We also commenced a 1:1 iPad program in 2015 and have been enhancing our incorporation of coding and robotics since then in order to value-add to the learning of our students. This supports our School Vision. A recent addition to our school learning spaces is our Sensory Room which includes a range of sensory and tactile items and toys. We have a positive and dedicated staff who work together cohesively across the school who are committed to the education of our students.

As a 'closed' mining town, Leinster is one of two unique Western Australian mining communities. Leinster has a population of approximately 400 permanent residents with the remainder of the workforce on a fly-in-fly-out roster. Leinster is a level 4 primary school with a small cohort of secondary students studying via courses offered and supported by the School of Isolated and Distance Education (SIDE).

Leinster Community School has a multicultural population drawing predominantly from Perth, New Zealand, Africa and Asia.

The town is serviced by BHP Billiton's Leinster Nickel Operations (NLN) and Agnew Goldfields' mining operations. Residents of the town predominantly work for BHP Billiton, Agnew Goldfields, Thiess, Spotless or contract maintenance and service companies. The school buildings are owned and maintained by BHP Billiton. These companies are very supportive of Leinster Community School financially, materially and logistically and there are close ties between the companies and our school community which serves to enhance the quality of educational outcomes for our students.

Parents regularly participate as classroom helpers and assist with school events such as assemblies and athletics carnivals. This enhances the school program and home-school connections. Parents are very supportive of the school with an active and engaged P&C and School Board.

At the 2016 census, Leonora had a population of 556, 27.6% of which were of Aboriginal descent.
Leonora District High School is a Level 4 school catering for students from Kindergarten to Year 12. The KindiLink Program is also provided for three-year old's and their parents or carers at our offsite building. These exciting 'play and learn' sessions, run by our early childhood specialist teacher and Aboriginal Education Officer, enable us to work with parents to help prepare their children for a successful start to schooling.
The student population consists of 80% aboriginal students. Leonora also has students of Thai, Pilipino and New Zealand ethnic origin. The Indigenous language of the area is Wangkatja but most students speak Aboriginal English.
In 2016 staff, parents and the wider community came together to create a shared vision. Through a process where every voice was heard, consensus was reached on a description of the school we want for our students. Our core values have been developed and are the foundation of the positive and respectful culture we have created. Through the Positive Behaviour Schools process we have defined the expected behaviours: Consider, Achieve Respect, Engage.
We believe interesting and relevant learning experiences are vital to student engagement. We tailor programs to individual student interests and learning styles giving our students the support and opportunities they need. In the secondary years this is being achieved through the implementation of Big Picture Education design.
Science Pathways: an integrated 'Two-way' science teaching and learning program has been implemented with the support from CSIRO and the local indigenous community. For Science Pathways, Learning on Country (LoC) is a whole-of-school integrated program where the community is empowered to drive educational activities based on the aspirations people have for their children's knowledge about looking after country. Activities consist of school-based, short trips, day trips or camps. LoC activities inform a cross-curricular learning program including language, literacy and numeracy, music, art and digital media.

We have comprehensive and proactive strategies to identify and cater for students at educational risk. An early intervention program has been implemented in the junior primary to support students at risk in literacy. There is a strong recycling program in the school and the school's vegetable gardens and the raising of chickens is very popular with our students.

Lesmurdie Primary School is committed to the values that we believe are essential in achieving the best possible outcomes for all students. We are guided by four core values in everything we do. In stating these values, we acknowledge that words alone are not sufficient; it is actions, based on these values that are important.

Learning: We have a positive approach to learning and encourage it in others; we advance student learning based on our belief that all students have the capacity to learn.

Excellence: We have high expectations of our students and ourselves. We set standards of excellence and strive to achieve them. The standards and expectations challenge all of us to give of our best.

Equity: We recognise the differing circumstances and needs of our students and are dedicated to achieving the best possible outcomes for all. We strive to create workplaces and learning environments that are free of discrimination, abuse or exploitation.

Care: We treat all individuals with care. Our relationships are based on trust, mutual respect and the acceptance of responsibility. We recognise the value of working in partnership with parents and carers and the wider community in providing a quality education for our students.

There is a strong recycling program in the school and the school's vegetable gardens and the raising of chickens is very popular with our students. All classes commit to an annual sustainability or environmental focus that builds understanding of how we can minimise our impact on the earth.

Our school supports a Sister School in Cambodia, Amphet Phnom Primary School, and each year our Student Councillors fund raise to provide $1000 for projects that support the students and staff.

Lesmurdie Primary School is very proud of its achievements, particularly with value added data which indicates the school is ensuring that high levels of academic achievement are maintained or improved. There is a strong culture of reflection and data driven analysis that underpins the strategic direction of the school.

Looma Remote Community School,5671,"

Looma Remote Community School is located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia approximately 130 km south east of Derby, some 30 km (dirt road) south of the main Derby to Fitzroy Crossing Highway. The school services the Looma Aboriginal Community (390-410 people) and the town of Camballin (30-40 people) approximately fifteen minutes from the school. Looma Community is built at the base of the picturesque Grant Range and the school enjoys magnificent vistas of the surrounding hills and rock formations that give Looma its name.

Looma Community is relatively young, having been established in the 1970's but in a short period of time, it has developed steadily. The population comprises of three major groups; Walmajarri, Nyikina and Mangala, with a smattering of others.

The name 'Looma' is Walmajarri for 'blue tongue lizard' and the lizard is the school and community logo. A traditional legend traces the history of a 'Looma' which travelled from Christmas Creek with its children to escape a big flood.

The Looma Community by choice is dry (no alcohol). There are three to four religious groups which at times interact with the school directly. Some traditional law practices do take place but with minimal effect on the school.

Looma Remote Community School originally started in 1982 as an annex of Camballin Special Aboriginal School. Camballin School officially closed at the end of 1983 when all Aboriginal students were relocated. Looma Remote Community School was officially opened on November 14, 1986. In 1998 the school became a District High School. As of 2003, Looma has been reclassified as a Remote Community School. The school has many resources which include; Administration Block and Library, Home Economics Room, Design and technology Centre, Art Room, Post Compulsory Room, Pre-Primary and Primary Classrooms, LOTE Room, Primary and Secondary Photocopy Rooms and Primary and Secondary Resource Rooms. Two DET Personnel Carriers and a bus are available for staff to take students on Department of Education and Training approved excursions.

School staff look for ways to overcome the geographic isolation of the community and provide a range of learning opportunities for students. Aboriginal English and Kriol are spoken by the majority of students. ESL teaching strategies are important for students to learn Standard Australian English.

The School strives for excellent parent-teacher-community support through an open door communication policy, active partnership with the community based Looma Education Committee that maintains vital links between the school and community by providing an open forum for school decision making and a 'Memorandum of Understanding' which is a shared responsibility agreement that addresses key issues within the community and school.


Teaching personnel at Looma RCS are accommodated in Camballin, which is a small township approximately 110 km south east of Derby and 15 km from Looma RCS. The population varies and it compromises teachers, health, Looma Community support staff and Liveringa Pastoral Company employees.

Looma and Camballin have a typical tropical climate. Temperatures are generally in the high 30's and 40's during the early and late months of the year. The 'dry' season offers near perfect weather. The 'wet' season is worth experiencing with excessive heat, humidity and rainfall, though it can restrict movement. Tropical thunderstorms prevail at this time of the year.

We celebrate many successes, including the 2018 winner of the WA Education Awards for Secondary School of the Year. One of our key focuses is the mentoring of our students, combined with a unique pastoral care program based on positive psychology, supporting each student to achieve their potential. The Everyday Leader Program offers social and emotional learning from Years 7 to 12, assisting students to develop an empowering, unshakeable belief about their own self-worth and personal value. Students are supported to find personal success through learning, and develop the skills required to confidently pursue their path beyond school.

With students from sixty different nationalities, the school's diversity and respect for difference is a feature of school life, enabling students to become positive and resilient, confident and enthusiastic about their futures and the contribution they can make to our community. An Intensive English Centre (IEC) supports the development of language skills, central to the development of children new to Australia, and to the integration of their families into new communities. Lynwood's core values of Inclusivity, Empathy, Equity, Respect, Resilience, Creativity and Achieving our Personal Best and the building of relationships based on Fairness and Inclusivity are keys to the effectiveness of our learning environment.

Lynwood is a unique school which specialises in Sustainability Education, both socially through a strong focus on building respectful and caring relationships with others and environmentally, with a focus on the part our students will play in the world of tomorrow. This focus has created a strong and positive culture within our school with Lynwood being the only Departmentally recognised Specialist School for Environment and Life Sciences with opportunities for students' state-wide to apply for and attend this specialist course from Years 7 to 10.

Lynwood Senior High School offers a broad curriculum including an approved Specialist Soccer Program which is open to state-wide applicants, and a comprehensive choice of General, ATAR and Vocational Education and Training pathways for Year 11 and 12 students. Lynwood's success in preparing students for university in both the Sciences and Humanities is well documented with many students consistently in the top 5% of university entrance scores. A Secondary Student Engagement Program in Year 11 and 12 called the Learning Environmental Academic Flexible (LEAF) Program and a Year 10 support program called ACCESS 10 meet the needs of a wide variety of our students.

Lynwood is gradually implementing a teaching methodology known as Explicit Instruction, guided by Dr Lorraine Hammond from Edith Cowan University and the work of Ybarra and Hollingsworth. This reinforces our strong belief in research based teaching and learning practices to improve outcomes for students. With a strong focus on community, the school promotes an inclusive environment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students; the Moorditj Waangkiny (Good/Solid Talk) Committee works hand in hand with the student committee, Birdiya Koorlanga (Boss children or young leaders). A native garden, Ngalark Karlup, is used to host events, and is an important meeting and teaching space.

Lynwood is complex, diverse and much loved by the school community and staff. The passion and commitment of students, staff and community members working together in a spirit of absolute positivity about what our students can achieve, is a significant hallmark of this very successful school.

Maddington Education Support Centre,6053,"

Maddington Education Support Centre (ESC) demonstrates a calm, warm and caring environment where every child is valued and treated as an individual. We are a small, but growing school, sharing a site with Maddington Primary School.

We enrol Kindergarten to Year 6 students who have a diagnosis of an intellectual or intellectual/ physical disability and inclusive of Students on the Autism Spectrum or Global Development Delay with High Educational Needs. All students have been placed into Maddington ESC in accordance with Schools Resourcing procedures.

All our staff are highly specialised in all areas of education support. They design and develop various programs that cater for all our students' needs throughout the centre, including the implementation of programs from outside agencies. All our classrooms are set up in a highly structured and rotational routine to implement a modified TEACCH program. This program is highly beneficial for all students regardless of their diagnosis and is implemented four mornings a week for numeracy and literacy.

In 2018, we have five separate education support classrooms for all year groups which makes sure our students have 1:1 tuition all morning until lunch.

Maddington ESC places an emphasis on rewards for positive and improved behaviours. This includes excursions at the end of each term and the establishment of tangible reward systems in each classroom. Every Friday, a student from each class is chosen for a principal's award. To assist in behaviour management 1.2.3 Magic was introduced into all classrooms to help children who had difficulties with compliance and on-task behaviours.

A positive emphasis resulted in less withdrawals and suspensions and an almost total absence of the use of unacceptable language. Maddington ESC incorporates strong social skills emphasis in all areas. The continuation of the PATHS programme (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) is important in helping change potentially challenging behaviours. The teaching of the core values; care, courtesy, respect and responsibility are essential to the process. A whole school approach ensures all children are taught essential strategies for anger management and communicating positively with people.

Many of our students have access to a school bus service. This is provided to students within an allocated area and if there are seats available by Perth Public Transport Authority (PTA). Applications are online for all families within a certain designated area. This is a door to door service that is offered free of charge. We have many families that live outside of this catchment area, but are happy to transport their children to school, so they are able to attend this great learning environment, which offers over and above the usual learning experiences.

All students have their own Ipad and all rooms have an electronic board for all students to interact with. We have invested in Robots and Bee Bots for coding so all students are fully interactive. We have large play areas and modern play equipment for all.

Parents are invited to meet with the principal to discuss issues, initiatives and any developments happening at Maddington ESC. Ideas are shared and issues dealt with in a timely manner.
Maddington ESC and Maddington Primary School share a joint P&C and School Council.

The committed parents and staff involved, reflects the strong partnership of all members of our school community, to support the learning outcomes of all student in both schools.

We recognise that your child's education is a partnership that requires input from you, the community and your child. Our staff are provided with the resources, support, environment and training to enable this to occur.

We adopt this same approach with your child. They are treated more like employees in that they have access to all parts of the college, its facilities, staff, tutors and equipment - everything they need to do the 'job' well. This means:
- completing ATAR and VET courses to the best of their ability
- actively participating in learning
- completing and submitting all work and tasks on time
- adhering to workplace expectations in terms of attendance, dress and workplace conduct
- seeking support and assistance when required.

Your child will also have to take part in performance review meetings, goal setting meetings and surveys to help them reach their goals. We coach, encourage and support your child to make pro-active adult choices, take ownership and responsibility for decision making and its affects their future.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY
Margaret River is a diverse community within which holistic, 'green'and back-to-basics lifestyles are practised.
The surfing culture which exists in Margaret River and its environs needs to be recognised. A significant number of parents and students are involved in this sporting/social activity, which has an influence on lifestyle, leisure activities, dress, language, attitudes and even reading material.
The sporting pursuits of this community cannot be discounted in considering its culture and social life. Most sports are offered to parents and students alike. Fitness, proficiency, teamwork, and the development focus of children's sports are important features of the community.
The overall picture is one of wide diversity within a monoculture, in which lifestyles issues frequently predominate, where surfing and sports are major preoccupations, with high regard to and for participative performing, musical and creative arts.

GROUNDS, BUILDINGS AND RESOURCES
The school covers a relatively large area: 4.69ha. Much of this area comprises a large sports/playing area, with established gardens in two main areas of the school.

It is proud to have the atmosphere of a large family while still delivering a quality education to its students.

Our school is an attractively presented and well-equipped facility. The open plan teaching block was completed after the old school was destroyed during the Meckering earthquake in 1968 and completely refurbished following a fire at the beginning of 1998. A further alteration was carried out in 1999 when a Rural Integration Upgrade extended the size and facilities within the junior classroom to provide for Kindergarten and Pre-Primary students. The transportable administration area, new library building and a two-room pavilion complete the building facilities, with all areas being air-conditioned. An undercover area was erected in 2002, funded by the P&C, which provides a welcome shaded area for students and an outside area for school assemblies. The grounds are highly attractive with native gardens and lawn areas, which are fully reticulated. As part of the school vision, additional play equipment has been added to the school grounds and the tennis court has been resurfaced to allow for student and community use.

The students are typical country kids who care about each other, their school and their town. The senior students take time to play with the younger children and watch out for them. The junior students look up to and admire the older students. This is highlighted in the CARE (Children Are Respected Equally) activity sessions.

Parents are welcomed and encouraged to be a part of Meckering Primary School community. Both the School Council and P&C are highly active and supportive in their respective roles. Parents value their school and commit considerable time and resources towards improving facilities, resources and learning opportunities. Camps and excursions are a significant feature of the annual program.

Meekatharra School Of The Air,5929,"

BRIEF HISTORY
In 1959 Meekatharra School of the Air was established with one teacher, who was Teacher in Charge, but under the direct control of The WA Correspondence School in Perth. The enrolment was 27 pupils. In 1979, twenty years after its inception and twenty years after it was first suggested at a Parents and Citizens meeting, Meekatharra School of the Air became an autonomous school with its own principal.

The original school site was on the grounds of The Royal Flying Doctor Service where it remained until 1975 when it moved to a site adjacent to Meekatharra District High School. In 1995 the existing school building was enlarged and upgraded. After a fire destroyed the building in 2007, the school was relocated to 3 demountable buildings on the Beachlands Primary School site and in 2011, staff moved into a brand new, purpose built building in Kempton Street in Bluff Point.


There has always been a strong alliance with The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS). Initially Meekatharra School of the Air utilised the radio frequencies of the RFDS. In 1975 the School of the Air received its own radio frequencies : 5260 megahertz (MHz) and 4880 MHz. In 2004 the school began delivering lessons via a state of the art ICT Satellite based system known as SatWeb.

DEMOGRAPHICS
With a current enrolment of 49 students (Term 1, 2005), Meekatharra is the largest of the five Schools of the Air in terms of school population. The boundaries of its 540 000 square kilometres stretch east of Wiluna to the Northern Territory border, north to Newman, as far west as Mullewa and in a southerly direction almost to Wubin.
The school caters for students in preschool (four year olds) through to Year 7, with most of the students enrolled living on stations.

PERSONNEL
The staff at Meekatharra School of the Air consists of the Principal, 6 full time teachers, a Library Support Officer and a Registrar. A teacher is also attached to the school in the role of STL ( Special Teacher Learning ) to support and assist staff in developing programs specifically suited to the individual needs of students in isolated situations.
Staff are appointed to the school through a merit selection process.

Home Tutors play a vital role in the type of schooling provided by MSOTA. Home Tutors supervise the students as they work, organise materials and play an active role in the learning process. The Home Tutor may be the mother, father or a governess who is employed to take on this important duty.

LEARNING PROGRAMS
Teachers communicate daily with their students through the ' SatWeb ' satellite communications system. These lessons are still referred to as 'Air lessons' for sentimental reasons. An air lesson may vary in length from 20 minutes (4 year olds) to 45 minutes. Families have the option of air lessons or non-air lessons. If they choose the non-air lesson option, they do all the same written work, but miss out on the daily contact with the school.The materials for all lessons are sent out at the end of the previous term, to ensure students have the necessary learning experiences and activities for each lesson in the coming term.

Clubs or options are also offered over the air. These may include Choir/Music, Art and Book Club.

Students utilise written materials produced by the West One, which is based in Leederville (Perth), in conjunction with individualised educational programs written by their teacher.
The children return a completed 'set' or unit of work each fortnight. These sets are marked by their teachers and returned with a report. The turnaround time for a set can be three weeks or more, depending on when or how often the mail is collected and the route it must take to arrive at its destination.

CONTACT WITH STUDENTS
Face to face contact is made at various times throughout the year. Teachers visit their students' families up to three times per year. To do this, they travel through isolated areas using the school vehicle (4WD), supplied by the Department of Education and Training. This vehicle is equipped with a satellite phone, so that contact can be made with the school when necessary. Teachers normally travel accompanied by other staff, however this is not always possible.

In addition to home visits contact with students occurs in a number of ways:
* Mini Camps and/or Activity Days are held at least once per term.
* An annual Learning Seminar is held for all Home Tutors and students. This seminar provides the opportunity for Home Tutors to further develop their teaching knowledge and skills.
* A camp for all School of the Air students (including those students from Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland, Carnarvon and Derby) is held annually at the PCYC Camp School in Rockingham.
* Students and families are always welcome to visit the school.

SCHOOL DECISION MAKING
The school has a School Council consisting of 4 community members and 2 staff from the school. There is a Student Council consisting of Senior students who meet regularly with the Principal.

Menzies Community School,5298,"



The town of Menzies is situated 130kms north of Kalgoorlie-Boulder and 110kms south of Leonora. Serving a mining, pastoral and local Aboriginal community, Menzies is the home of Wangkatja people who maintain strong family links to the town and surrounding country. Menzies is also a popular tourist destination with nearby Lake Ballard attracting international visitors.

Menzies Community School caters for students from Years K - 12. Approximately 120 people live in Menzies and in recent times the school's student population has ranged between 35 - 40 students.

Strong community partnerships are a distinctive feature of Menzies Community School and the community plays an active role in supporting the school and in ensuring that students attend school when they are in the community.

In collaboration with neighbouring schools and other agencies we are in the process of expanding our programs to cater for increasing numbers of secondary students. Students also have the option of studying through the School of Isolated and Distance Education while attending our school.

For many years our school has used a variety of best practice and innovative programs to improve overall school performance. We believe that it is important to work collaboratively with families in order to improve their capacity to meet the needs of their children. We use an integrated multi-agency approach to assist families and students, with a strong focus on prevention, assessment and intervention to achieve targeted outcomes for students. We believe that a focus on early childhood development will improve outcomes for students as they move through school and transition from secondary school to meaningful training / employment is a key community priority.

The town of Menzies has a colourful history which makes it unique in many ways. Menzies was proclaimed a municipality in 1895 following the discovery of gold. During this period Menzies boasted 13 hotels, 3 banks, its own breweries and cordial factories, a Post Office with a staff of 25, a school with 205 pupils, a public library and 4 churches. Menzies School opened its doors in 1897 and the original school building and teachers' house are still in use today. Following a pattern which has become typical of many gold mining towns, people drifted away and the area declined, however despite these changing fortunes, Menzies has continued to survive.

Located 256 kilometres east of Perth in the Central Wheatbelt, Merredin College is a lighthouse rural school providing a high quality educational program for 600 students from K-12. We are unique because our students can remain in the safety of the community in which they were born and at the same school for their entire education. Our staff and our families are true partners in the entire schooling process. From 2017, we become an Independent Public School.

Our vision states 'Merredin College is the benchmark in rural educational excellence. We aspire to develop a community of engaged, creative and independent lifelong learners who aim high, value diversity and contribute positively to the global community.' Our rigorous yet supportive teaching programs encourage students to become independent learners; beginning in Kindergarten and developed through to Year 12.

We provide engagement programs for our Aboriginal students and our Education Support students have their needs met through tailored support. ICT is embedded to ensure students learn in a contemporary environment and leave school with the skills needed to function in the 21st Century.

We offer a diverse range of subjects for our K-6 students and pride ourselves on our high quality Music and Dance programs. Specialist teachers and rooms such as the design and technology workshops, science laboratories and the school farm (for the Kitchen Garden project) are accessed by our primary students. This provides amazing opportunities for enrichment and extension, and lessens the angst experienced when students move into secondary. Specialist programs can be introduced from the early years so students have the background to achieve at their potential in Year 12.

For Year 7-10 students, a challenging program is provided in the core areas. Health and Physical Education is highly valued, with many extra opportunities on offer. Arts studies include Art, Dance and Drama. Technology & Enterprise comprises Agriculture, Design & Technology, Home Economics and Information Technology (Computing).

Our talented teachers take pride in ensuring our students achieve attainment.

Four values guide the practices, expectations and behaviour of our students and staff. These include excellence, achievement, respect and integrity. The values underpin the three key areas of our Strategic Plan including Success for all Students, High Quality Teaching and Leadership, and Positive Learning Environment and Culture. Excellence in behaviour and achievement is acknowledged via a variety of initiatives. As a staff we constantly strive for effective and consistently applied behaviour management and excellent attendance.
We believe in meeting the needs of the whole student and as a result pastoral care is a significant staff commitment. Our caring and expert Student Services team support each student's social and emotional needs. Our daily Breakfast Club run by volunteer staff ensures all students start the day well-fed.

Over $30 million dollars was spent on education in Merredin in 2011.

Middle Swan Primary School,5426,"

Middle Swan Primary School (MSPS) is an award-winning school and has been an Independent Public School since 2011. It is a large, well-resourced and well equipped school, catering for approximately 500 students enrolled from Kindergarten to Year 6. The school population is drawn mainly from Stratton and the nearby suburbs of Jane Brook and Middle Swan.

The schools priorities include
* Vocabulary,
* Mental Calculation and
* Social and Emotional Well-being of students.

In particular AEDC results indicate that language skills are an area of need in the Swan region hence the focus on interventions in the early years. Since 2014 the innovative language program Talk 4 Writing has been implemented as an opportunity to extend student vocabulary from Kindergarten to Year 6. A Speech Pathologist is engaged 2 days a week to screen and implement programs in the Kindergarten years. 'Letters and Sounds' and 'Words Their Way' from K-6 are additional programs that focus on developing the skills required for learning sounds and words. In 2015 NAPLAN reflected an upward trend in results especially in Writing, with Year 3 performing above the state average. Such positive results can be directly attributed to the focus staff have on the learning of Vocabulary and the programs they implement.

The fifty strong staff ensure students experience success at school and provide relevant, often innovative programs in a supportive environment. Staff are continually updating their skills to ensure students achieve their potential. Literacy, Numeracy, Science, ICT, The Arts and the learning environment are constant priority areas and receive considerable professional learning investment. Middle Swan Primary School works to ensure all students feel safe at school through conducting evidence-based programs and has strong links with universities, community organisations and education associations. The school also offers specialist programs in Physical Education, Visual Art, Choir, Drumbeat, Cycling, Recorder and individualised tutoring where a need is required.

The school benefits from the invaluable presence of the Child and Parent Centre. The centre provides an array of services including-
* Breakfast pickup for students
* Houses the school's breakfast club
* On site Doctor on Mondays
* Talk it Out counselling services
* Parenting Workshops
* Additional Speech therapy services

In 2015 the school's attendance rate was above the state average which can be directly linked to the support of the Child and Parent Centre combined with the school's focus.

The school is supported by a dedicated group of parents who participate in the School Board, the Parents and Citizens group, the canteen, and assist in classrooms and on excursions. The school has a pastoral care focus and a chaplain who assist parents and students. An Aboriginal and Islander Education Officer works to support indigenous students in their learning who make up approximately 20% of the school population.

Middle Swan Primary School is renowned for its high quality programs including numeracy, literacy and inquiry learning, where students are encouraged to think for themselves, take responsibility and solve problems.

School Of Special Educational Needs: Behaviour And Engagement,6200,"

The School of Special Educational Needs: Behaviour and Engagement (SSEN:BE) provides educational support and services for students with extreme, complex and challenging behaviours. Support is available across the public school system

Intensive support to students and consultative support to schools is delivered through 13 engagement centres and the Midland Learning Academy (the Academy). The services of the engagement centres and the Academy are coordinated through SSEN:BE, which provides the administrative structure that oversees and manages these services as a statewide model of support for schools, teachers and students.

Engagement Centres coordinate the K-12 provision of the following three services:
- Professional learning to improve student engagement and behaviour.
- Consultative support for schools needing additional advice on dealing with challenging behaviour and managing severely disengaged students and/or those with very complex needs.
- Intensive support for individual students exhibiting the most extreme, challenging and complex needs.

The Academy is a small school model designed for highly disengaged students who are no longer participating in mainstream schooling and are unlikely to reengage with mainstream schooling even with the additional support and services provided by engagement centres.

The Academy is more informal than a standard school with students having individualised learning programs based on their interests and aspirations. Teachers guide students through their program with the support of family and mentors. Learning occurs on site and also involves workplace and community engagement related to each student's learning goals.

MINGENEW PRIMARY SCHOOL

Mingenew is a progressive rural community set in picturesque and undulating farmland. It enjoys all the lifestyle benefits of rural living and yet is only 35 minutes from the coast and 1 hour from the city of Geraldton. It is a safe, happy community with a very low crime rate and a great place to discover what rural living is all about. The town is situated approximately 105km south east of Geraldton, with an approximate population of 600 people, of whom over 60 per cent reside on farms. Half of the students at school make use of the four bus services.

Mingenew is the largest grain receival point in the southern hemisphere and there is a large number of industrial businesses in the town to support the farming industry. The major source of industry is grain, sheep and cattle farming with a substantial farm tree nursery adding to the variation of industries around the district. The businesses and employment in the town are closely dependent on the rural activities.

Mingenew Primary School is a very happy and social school. All students are familiar with each other and the school creed of 'Pride and Persistence' reflects a stimulating and caring environment where lasting friendships are made between teachers, parents and students. Students are actively encouraged in all endeavours, academic, artistic, sport or otherwise.

Staff structure includes 4 teachers, (Including Principal), a part time DOTT relief teacher, two Teacher Assistants, a Registrar, Library Officer, an Aboriginal Islander Education Officer, two School Cleaners, and a Gardener.

The school buildings and gardens are well maintained. The classrooms are bright, air conditioned and conducive to teaching and learning. School buildings include an Early Childhood wing that also houses the Computer room and Community room, a Middle/Senior wing, an Administration block, a transportable building that is used for explicit instruction programs, a Library and Resource Centre, a Arts/Music building and several storage sheds. Garden and lawn areas are reticulated, as is half of the school oval. The Kindergarten section is on campus and has its own playground equipment, while the primary students have their own separate playground.

Multi aged class structures include K, PP/1 2/3, 4/5/6 classes. Timetabling allows for collaborative planning after an early close on Tuesdays. School's priorities for 2015 encompass Mathematics: Number and Algebra, English: Grammar and Punctuation, Reading and Writing. Each priority is well supported with appropriate funding and resources.

The School Council is a vital and active body within the school in the area of school development planning and communication to the wider community. The P & C is a well represented body which provides great support to the school through extensive fund raising, work and sports committees. Their involvement in school activities is very high. The student numbers at the school have remained fairly constant throughout the various phases of economic climates.

Within the local community sporting activities are keenly supported and include tennis, football, cricket, netball, lawn bowls, polo-crosse and hockey. During March the Turf Club holds a race meeting while the Midwest Mingenew Lions Expo is held in September. Coalseam Park is a Reserve area where history states that it was here that the first coal was mined in W.A. in 1846. Wildflowers in season are a drawcard for many visitors to the area.

Moora Primary School,5313,"

Moora Primary School is a Level 4 Independent Public School, situated 172 km north of Perth. The school community is drawn from the Moora town site and surrounding rural areas and caters for students from Kindergarten to Year 6. Students who attend the school are from a variety of backgrounds, with many travelling by bus from farms daily.
Our school was established in 1897 making it one of the oldest primary schools in Western Australia. Over the years we have served as a Primary School, District High School and the birthplace of Central Midlands Senior High School.

Moora Primary School (PS) is a dynamic learning community where members work collaboratively to give every child the opportunity to realise their full potential and to become resilient, confident and respectful citizens. The school has always enjoyed a strong community spirit developed over decades from parent and community involvement within the school. A close, supportive relationship continues to exist between students, staff and parents enabling us to know each student as an individual. Staff and students work together cooperatively to create a positive school environment in which every student feels safe and is able to learn in a friendly and caring atmosphere.

Moora PS is a distinctive school where students experience success due to high quality teaching and learning. We are proud of our school and our collective achievements. It is achieved through a whole school evidence-based approach to Literacy and Numeracy with targeted effectiveness and differentiation for every child, including remediation and extension. We pride ourselves on a reputation for inclusivity, values, pastoral care, strong academic results and community engagement.

We have a committed, proactive and dedicated staff working to help each child be as successful as they can be. Our staff have high expectations and adopt a wide variety of innovative teaching practices.

We begin every week with a 'Student of the Week' Assembly where students are rewarded for displaying exemplary behaviour and attitudes. Our records show the ongoing benefits of our newly implemented 'ABK' (Awesomely Behaved Kids) behaviour management program, and the explicit modelling and teaching of these standards to our students.
We offer a diverse range of subjects including Visual Arts, Drama and Music. Our other specialist areas include Physical Education and Science.

As a newly appointed Independent Public School in 2015, The Moora School Board works with the Principal to set and monitor the key directions of the school and to make a positive contribution to the continued development of the school. The Board includes representatives from the parent and staff bodies, the Parents & Citizens Association (P&C) and the community. A proactive P&C continues to support the school with numerous fundraising campaigns each year to assist in the provision of resources and equipment for the school. This partnership with the community provides a strong support base upon which the school has thrived for many decades.

Whilst new facilities provide for many opportunities, it is the school's learning and teaching culture of 'Excellence' and its strong sense of community that drives our Moora PS vision; 'To develop students who are well prepared, strive for excellence and positively contribute to society.'
As an Independent Public School we aim to continue to increase our Kindergarten to Year 6 enrolments by increasing our reputation for excellence. Our challenge is to continue to target areas to further develop our students as successful, motivated learners. We are confident that our focus on the development of each individual child and their learning can be achieved with the support of a strong partnership between the school and the school community. Together, as a community, we are building the learning foundations and futures of our children, just as our predecessors have done for more than 100 years.

SCHOOL VISION

The moon was high and full in a cloudless night sky, lighting the land between the two creeks. Around the remains of a large fire the old people sat talking and worrying about the past, the future and their children. The oldest man leaned forward, took a handful of the warm white ash from the edge of the fire and threw it into the air. As the group watched the mist of ash in the moonlit air they saw the future bright and clear-
Noongar kids leading in the Wadjela world.
Prominent business people, doctors, lawyers and teachers
Champion sportsmen and women.Talented musicians and actors..
Noongar people supporting each other and making their culture strong.

This is the dreaming of the old people.

We can all make that dreaming happen.

School Profile

The College is a systemic school set in the quiet surrounds of Black Adder Creek. There are 130 students enrolled at Moorditj Noongar Community College between 3 year old Kindergarten and Year 7. The classes are small compared to other schools and this enables students to receive significantly more teacher-pupil time together. The students live in the Midland area and immediate surrounding suburbs. Attendance rates are high because the children have access to transportation to and from school. Although there is a significant amount of movement to and from other schools many students return to Moorditj because they miss their friends and extended family members within the Indigenous context. The design of the buildings is symbolic of aspects of Aboriginal Culture
e.g. Meeting place for community.
Noongar Seasons depicted in mosaics.
Building are angled to give the shape of the Wakarl.

STAFF
The staff is predominately Indigenous. All teaching and several support staff members have the appropriate qualifications. Newer support staff receive training on the job and are encouraged to engage in further studies.
Each class has at least one support staff member in the room every day. Moorditj has the service of four Teacher Assistants, two of whom are Special Needs Assistants. Aboriginal and Islander Education Officers (AIEOs) and several CDEP workers further support the programs at the school. All staff members at Moorditj are committed to personal professional development in order to support the School Priorities and the many special program established at the school.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Literacy Through Culture Project
The Smith Family Trust, with funding from Newmont Mining, have enabled us to establish a partnership with Edith Cowan University throughout 2005/2006. The teaching staff will engage in a longitudinal research study of the development of phonological awareness in Indigenous students. Both teaching and support staff members will undertake professional learning using the Let's Decode Strategy. This whole school approach to developing the basic requirements for reading and writing will improve the literacy outcomes across the year levels.
School Priorities
Literacy, Numeracy and Behaviour Management will continue to be high priorities for the students at Moorditj Noongar Community College along with these we will continue to focus on Music, Sport and the Fine Arts. Thus giving to the Indigenous students the best possible opportunities to develop their innate talents.

Mount Hawthorn Education Support Centre,6069,"



Mount Hawthorn Education Support Centre is a proud Independent Public School for children with special needs with a vision to promote the capabilities and independence of each child.

We aim to develop the necessary educational, physical and social skills and knowledge to prepare each child for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of secondary school. Our school uses the principles of applied behaviour analysis, and the curriculum is modified and broken down into small tasks which are taught separately using reinforcers to guide behaviour. Basic skills are then built on gradually at a speed suitable for each child.

To make sure children are challenged and supported, we offer two learning groups. The first consists of students who are diagnosed with a variety of intellectual disabilities who find it easier to work in a class with fewer students and a high ratio of staff to students. The second group comprises the Early Intensive Intervention Program students who have autism but no intellectual disability and who are aiming to go into mainstream full-time.

Our staff strive to provide a safe, socially just and supportive environment for children. To achieve this, we work closely with parents, carers, members of the local community and supporting agencies. Our school shares a campus, school board and a P&C with Mount Hawthorn Primary School, and we enjoy a strong relationship with its staff and local community.

Children can play in an enclosed outdoor sensory area with sandpit and toys on tiger turf. Our children mix with Mount Hawthorn Primary School children in the main playgrounds during recess and lunch breaks and are supported by education assistants at all times. Many of our students also attend selected mainstream classes to ensure plenty of socialisation with their mainstream peers.

Mount Margaret Remote Community School,5329,"

Mt Margaret Aboriginal Community is situated 32 kilometres south west of Laverton on an unsealed road and 330 kms north east of WA's largest provincial city, Kalgoorlie. Mt Margaret was extensively mined for gold in the late 1800s and the original Mt Margaret Mission was established in the 1920s. The small community is run by AMOS (Aboriginal Movement for Outback Survival) with an elected chairperson and manager. The population of Mt Margaret is approximately 90. In 2004 a significant upgrade to the community saw the roads sealed and 8 modern, new houses built. Power is supplied by diesel generators and water is obtained from a bore. There are no shopping, medical or fuel supplies currently available in the community. The present school facilities were established in 1978 and officially opened in 1982.

The school caters for K to Year 6. Aboriginal English is the first language of most of the students, but there are some small cohorts for whom Ngaanyatjarra or Wangkatha is their first language. The traditional language, Wangkatha, is taught as a subject. The large school playground is enhanced by mature trees and neat garden and lawn areas. The students share the responsibility for maintaining the attractive environment.

The Mt Margaret area is semi-desert, with the majority of the rainfall occurring from December to March. Summertime temperatures are stable, with a night time minimum of about 20 degrees, rising to the high 30s and 40s during the day. In winter temperatures can drop to 4 degrees at night and rise to around 17 - 24 degrees during the day. On venturing just one km past the rocky slopes of Mt Margaret, one encounters the magnificent shores of Lake Carey, a 130 km long, dry salt lake, bordered by awesome colourful shale and sandstone cliffs and occasionally offering up gold nuggets that attract prospectors from all over Australia. In early spring the area bursts into a profusion of wild flowers with occasional fresh water pools and rock holes.

School priorities in 2015 are literacy and numeracy. The school has a strong values program based on the Australian Curriculum and the Plan for Government Schools and contextualised specifically for Mt Margaret School and Community. The school behaviour management plan reflects these values and the emphasis is on students learning to manage their own behaviour, a strategy which is fully supported by students, staff and parents/ carers.

The school and community have an excellent relationship with local mining companies who support the school in various ways, including our healthy lunch program and provide opportunities for employment.

Mt Margaret School exists as an integral part of the Mt Margaret Community. It is committed to providing a flexible, caring learning environment that recognises Aboriginal culture to ensure learning opportunities for all students to achieve success through a quality education.

If you are seeking adventure, Aboriginal culture and a taste of Outback Australia then Mt Margaret is hard to beat!

Muludja Remote Community School,5723,"

At the Muludja Remote Community School, our motto is 'Binyidi, Smart and Skudda'. Also known as the 'Muludja Way', the motto builds on our Stronger Smarter philosophy which respects the traditional owners, the Gooniyandi people.

Binyidi means strong/hard in Gooniyandi which represents the strength and identity students get through their local Aboriginal culture.

Smart is for the learning in Standard Australian English that happens at school which serves as a bridge between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal culture.

Skudda means awesome or deadly in Kriol as the students' first language.

Our motto recognises the challenges our 40 Kindergarten to Year 6 students face having to know three languages and cultures. All students are Aboriginal and speak Kriol with English as their second language. Students know some of the local Gooniyandi language and a mixture of words from nearby languages such as Walmajarri.

Located approximately 33km from Fitzroy Crossing our school is seen as the bridge between different cultures in the region.

Our teachers are usually from vastly different cultural backgrounds and enjoy a strong bond with their students and families. We strive to build an authentic and interactive experience for teachers and their students.

Our main priorities are the Aboriginal Literacy Strategy, Explicitly Teaching and the Kimberley Program, which are in line with the Department of Education's priorities for Remote Schools.

ICT and STEM are also priorities with a focus on creative problem solving and coding skills in the early years. We are also developing a strong focus on literacy, numeracy, attendance, student behaviour and community partnerships.

Our school staff are focused on improved academic outcomes for Muludja students. Our programs include the Paul Swan Mathematics Program and the K-2 Valley Network for the Early Years. We also focus on reading, in particular phonics and the guided reading structure. We continue to implement the PLD Dianna Riggs Spelling program running as a whole school approach.

The school implemented Word Grammar Fun and Cracking the Code program from the PEEL Language centre. The staff were also involved in the Leadership for Numeracy Learning and the ALERT program that was run and monitored by the staff of Telethon Kids.

We have also implemented the Aboriginal Cultural Framework focusing on the relationship with students, their parents and the wider community. We seek advice and guidance from our Aboriginal Islander Education Officer staff in the implementation of the Aboriginal Cultural Standards Framework.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

Ngalapita Remote Community School,5789,"



Ngalapita Remote Community School opened December 1, 2003 in the community of Koorabye. The name for the school comes from a nearby billabong which is central to the lives of the Aboriginal people, who, apart from the teachers, make up this community.

At Ngalapita Remote Community School we promote a culture that contributes to and supports learning. We foster academic, social and emotional achievement with respectful relationships to ensure a positive, inclusive and supportive environment. We value high quality teaching, learning and professional learning to foster teacher development, student achievement and a school that operates efficiently. We believe students, staff, parents, guardians and community are genuine partners in education who share in the teaching, learning and decision making of the school environment.

Koorabye community occupies one square kilometer of Kalyeeda Station and is made up of eleven houses. The school grounds, teachers' houses and basketball court are situated 100m to the east of the community. Also part of this cluster is a donga, used to accommodate visiting service providers. The school consists of two large classrooms, a principal's office, administration area, kitchen, sports shed, gardening shed and library. The community is accessed from an unsealed road that extends approximately 95km from the Great Northern Highway, passing through Yungngora (Noonkanbah) Community. The Kimberley wet season (November to April) can make access to the community difficult for staff, students, community members and service providers.

Ngalapita is a Level 3 primary school. The student cohort is between 7 and 15, though visiting students add to the population seasonally. The school currently employs a full time teacher, a principal and two AIEOs, a cleaner and a gardener. The school has developed a relationship with Universities in Perth and often has a student teacher for their long Practicums which can vary from 7 to 10 weeks.

The school has a primary focus on developing strong Literacy and Numeracy skills. Ngalapita is well-resourced and the technology available includes LEGO WeDo 2.0, OSMO, Sphero, Dash and Dot plus Ipads, laptops and Interactive Whiteboards. The school is networked and has satellite internet access in all rooms. Both classrooms are fitted with sound field systems.

Walmajarri is the traditional language of the members of this community. Most of the children speak Kriol as their first language. Staff members recognise the students as English as a Second Language (ESL) learners and employ teaching strategies that meet their needs. All students have an Individualised Learning Plan (ILP) and Special Education Needs (SEN) reporting is used to convey student achievements to parents.

Settled in 1866, Roebourne is WA's oldest surviving town north of Geraldton. In fact it is the oldest settlement between Geraldton and Darwin and has an estimated population of 1,200 people. Roebourne is located near the Pilbara coast, approximately 1500 km north of Perth and 40 kilometres east of Karratha. Most of the staff live in Karratha and commute each day out to Roebourne.

The weather in the area is sub-tropical. There is the wet season [summer] characterised by hot days and occasional heavy rainfall, whereas the dry season [winter] is much cooler with little to no rainfall. The average maximum temperature for the year is 34.3 degrees centigrade, with dry season temperatures consistently over 35 degrees centigrade and the average minimum 20.7 degrees centigrade. Rainfall averages approximately 290mm a year.

Education in the town has a long and rich history, with the first formal schooling starting in 1874. In 1892 a masonry building, in Hampton St, replaced the former timber framed building of 1884. The school moved onto the present site in 1961.

The school caters to students from Kindergarten to Year 12, with approximately 99% of its cohort being Aboriginal. Although there are a number of language groups in Roebourne, the students generally come from three main language groups - the Ngarluma people who are the traditional owners of the land, the Yindjibarndi people and the Banyjima people. The students speak a range of languages as well as Aboriginal English. Teachers are expected to adopt and to use ESL strategies for most of the students throughout the school.

While the major emphasis continues to be Literacy and Numeracy for all students, secondary students focus on employment preparation. Students have opportunities to participate in Vocational Education and Training programs which work closely with local organisations, businesses and the mining industry.

Aboriginal and Islander Education Officers (AIEO's) have significant roles in the school and are seen as teachers-in-training for most activities. They provide essential links to the community and provide teachers with cultural expertise and knowledge. An understanding, appreciation and respect for Aboriginal culture is paramount to the success of any teaching programme within the school.

The school is supported by the community and through Aboriginal Corporations and agencies, as well as by mining and other companies, Government Departments and non government organisations. The community has a strong arts base and this has influenced the school community in developing a strategic plan, with a movement to Arts based programs so as to engage a wider range of students.

Our comprehensive selection of academic and vocational education and training pathways gives students the choice of university study, further training or employment.

Learning programs include art, outdoor education, design and technology, dance and drama, home economics, media studies, music, photography and sport. Our highly regarded specialist programs in maritime and marine studies and contemporary music are highly valued by our community. Other special programs include the secondary extension and challenge program, Autism extension program and elite soccer program. Special needs students are supported with relevant programs and individual assistance.

Our Positive Behaviour Support Program promotes a common and consistent approach to behaviour, centred around the core principles of being organised, respectful, caring and achieving (ORCA). Our commitment to our students, and the proven outcomes of their success, has positioned us as a school of choice.

One Arm Point Remote Community School,5583,"

One Arm Point Remote Community School is in Ardyaloon (One Arm Point), an Aboriginal community on the Dampier Peninsula in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.

We are respectful of self, others and culture, and are committed to developing students who are literate, numerate and resilient lifelong learners. We aim to help all students reach their full potential, with each one having the tools to make informed, considered decisions and also the skills and knowledge to find meaningful employment beyond their school years.

The local Bardi Jawi culture is embedded into our school curriculum in many ways including Bardi language lessons, a fortnightly cultural program, a school and community cultural camp and engagement with local service providers, such as the Jawi Rangers.

Our school has a dynamic staff from various backgrounds, including a number of local Aboriginal staff who provide integral knowledge and expertise regarding students and our school's unique context.

Strong relationships with the local community and local service providers form the base of a collaborative and targeted approach aimed at improving outcomes across the board and ensuring the children of Ardyaloon are given every opportunity to succeed.

Almost 100km of the 218km journey from Broome to Ardyaloon Community is unsealed road requiring a 4wd to access and its changing condition can have a broad impact on travel times. During the wet season, the road to Ardyaloon Community is often closed for days and sometimes weeks at a time.

Our priorities:

Early childhood - To provide the community with a regular 0 to 3 years of age program and extended Kindergarten times to 20 hours per week.

English - To follow a whole school approach and improve English skills and understandings for all students. Our particular focus is on the explicit teaching of all components of English, while maintaining an engaging and culturally relevant curriculum.

Mathematics - To improve the numeracy skills of all students and to provide developmentally appropriate learning experiences catering to individual learning needs.

Attendance - To increase attendance rates across all years, but with a particular focus on Kindergarten and secondary school.

Secondary pathways - To offer secondary students relevant training and experience in career pathways available to them on country. VET studies are based around aquaculture and also include conservation and land management, small engine mechanics and hospitality.

Community Partnerships - To continue to work collaboratively with our school council, the Ardyaloon council, the local community and service providers in an effort to maximise wellbeing, attendance, social and academic outcomes for all students.

Culture - To continue to implement a consistent and meaningful cultural program and Bardi language program, with regular community input.


We have recently established a music program, a functioning manual arts room and program, a native plant nursery and also a high school common room. We are currently working on developing a football training program, a school radio program, a sustainable canteen and a school-wide fish appreciation program facilitated by the secondary school aquaculture students.

One Arm Point Remote Community School is a wonderful school in an amazing community situated in a remarkable part of Western Australia with a staff that is passionate, hardworking and committed to helping Ardyaloon students become strong, proud and resilient members of society and positive leaders of the future.

Parkwood Primary School opened in 1975 and is at the eastern end of the Fremantle-Peel Education District. The school sits adjacent to Lynwood Senior High School. Our students enjoy quality facilities, equipment and resources to enhance their learning experiences.

Formerly one of the largest primary schools in Western Australia, demographic changes have resulted in a student enrolment of approximately 520 students from Kindergarten to Year 6. This includes just in excess of 50 children in the Intensive English Centre.

The Intensive English Centre (IEC) addresses the needs of refugees and other children with little or no English. The IEC provides these children with a nurturing environment in which to develop proficiency in written and spoken English. Some arrive with no prior education. After 12 to 18 months, when these children have developed sufficient skills to enable them to participate effectively in mainstream schooling, they enrol in their local school. As Parkwood Primary School is one of only 7 primary schools in W.A. with an IEC, our students are drawn from a wide section of the south-east metropolitan area.

There is a commitment by staff to addressing the educational, social and emotional needs of our students. In an age where education is undergoing rapid innovation and change, the programs we provide are designed to be intellectually challenging, within a supportive environment. Our school culture has a strong values-base where staff, students, parents and community members are treated with respect. We also aim to develop in our students an understanding that learning is to be enjoyed and should be enthusiastically pursued.

Students have access to a range of programs, including Primary Extension and Challenge (PEAC) for identified students, instrumental music and environmental education programs. We are entering our third year with a Science specialist program. The school has a physical education program aimed at developing more active lifestyles among our students. The Parents and Citizens Association is a proactive body that works in partnership with the school, to provide opportunities to enhance the experiences of our students.

Pia Wadjarri Remote Community School,5784,"

Location

Pia Wadjarri Remote Community School is situated 70kms from the Shire of Murchison, the only local government authority in Australia not centred in a town or regional centre.

The closest regional centre is Geraldton which is situated 330kms south west of Pia, travelling 220kms on unsealed roads to Yalgoo or Mullewa before 'turning right' on bitumen roads that lead to Geraldton. Although all roads in the Murchison Area are well maintained by the shire, road conditions are subject to the weather with flash floods making it 4WD access only at certain times of the year.

History

A strong sense of history is evident with the original land granted to the Wadjarri people by Sir John Forrest in recognition of their kindness in nursing him back to health at 'Bia Spring'. The surrounding pastoral stations abound in historical wealth and the Dreaming meets the present in the land and its people.

The school is an integral part of the Pia Wadjarri Aboriginal Community Incorporated, providing education for the community and employment for some community members. Approximately 70 people make up the community and the school has an enrolment of up to 20 students. Seeking to retain a community focus the school invites elders and community members to participate in school activities. Cultural learning is imperative for all students.

It all began when Rachel Papertalk (the current AIEO) and her mother Irene Simpson decided to teach Rachel's daughter and nephew in the community rather than send them away for their schooling. Rachel maintained her role as teacher as the number of children increased and the children were eventually enrolled as students of Meekatharra School of the Air. Numbers of students remained constant and the new school was built and opened in August 2002. Founder Principal was Gail Creswell.

The school logo, featuring a kangaroo, emu and bangarra on interwoven tracks connecting these levels, was designed by past student Ike Simpson.

Buildings

The school buildings comprise of two classrooms which provide a learning environment for Kindergarten to Year 12; a Home Economics/Library and an administration block.

The school grounds feature adventure playground and grassed playing area. There are fruit trees, vegetable gardens, chickens, rooster and ducks, a Husbandry area and Aquaculture tanks which have marron and fish. An 'Active After School' program is being conducted at the school.

Our Year 5 and 6 students participate in a camp with students from Nyabing and Kukerin Primary School every second year. We aim for our students to engage fully with their educational experiences to produce life-long interests in learning and become a valuable member of the wider community.

Pingrup Primary school is well equipped for 21st Century learning. All classrooms are air-conditioned and resourced with appropriate Information, Communication and Technology hardware. The staff and students regularly use interactive whiteboards, document cameras, desk-top computers, laptops, iPads, Apple TV and printers. The latest addition is a BenQ Smart TV which is located in the library.

We have been gradually making improvements to our junior playground which now includes a bike path, outdoor climbing equipment and a mud kitchen in the sandpit. Older students have a wide variety of sporting equipment to choose from including all ball sports and a Sticky Wicket for cricket. Our outdoor playground areas, undercover areas, lunch shelter and gardens provide our students with not only good sporting areas, but also relaxing and shady areas important for sitting, talking and participating in imaginative play.

Our school receives strong support from the Parents and Citizens (P&C) Association. Our fantastic parents and community groups continually support us and form an important resource encouraging community pride and promoting experiences that are highly beneficial for our students' development. A strong sense of community gives our students real life experiences to be connected with one another and make a real difference to the world around them.

We are proud of our students and know that your child would love to be part of our educational family.

Our Academic Extension Program complements regular school programming and offers an extensive extracurricular calendar focused on excursions, national competitions, and the public exhibition of student project work. The program seeks to enhance each student's capacity to think critically and creatively, by presenting them with a variety of experiences and challenges. Our hope is to build skilled and independent learners capable of creating solutions for the future.

The Pinjarra Football Academy includes programs for both male and female athletes, with AFL football as the context for learning. It not only focuses on supporting academic success but has a strong focus on fostering responsibility, teamwork, and good citizenship.

In addition to specialty programs, students have access to automotive and engineering workshops, a school farm, digital media and technology, and an environment rich with outdoor recreation opportunities.

Port Hedland School Of The Air,5930,"

Port Hedland School of the Air enables distance education students in the Pilbara to have peer and teacher contact on a regular basis. Catering for the needs of students in distance education can be challenging, however we work hard to tailor our programs to your individual child. Most students work on modified or specifically designed programs, which cater for their individual developmental needs.

Enrolments fluctuate from 20 to 50 with students mostly located on cattle stations and within national parks. Whilst being the smallest of the five Western Australian Schools of the Air, our school has the second largest area, covering 560 000 square km.

Students are provided with laptop computers, a NBN Co Internet connection, school supplies and printed learning programmes based on the Australian (Western Australian) Curriculum. Each child attends a series of 40 minute online lessons with their teachers throughout the day, in addition to completing offline materials. Students also utilise technology to complete other online educational activities as prescribed by their teachers. The school day commences at 8.00am and concludes at 2.20pm, much the same as mainstream schools in the Pilbara.

Most children return and complete 'sets' (programs of work) regularly which are assessed by their teachers. Each child attends a series of 40 minute online sessions throughout the day with their teachers, in addition to completing offline materials. Students also utilise technology to complete other online educational activities as prescribed by their teachers.

To enhance opportunities for social development, students attend several camps throughout the year, as well as receive home visits. These include the Home Tutors Seminar, Mid-Year Camp, School of the Air (SOTA) Muster and bi-annual Canberra Camp. These face-to-face interactions are vital to our students' development.

Teachers communicate daily with their students through ZOOM, an internet-based system that replaced HF radio in 2004. It provides high quality voice clarity, as well as a range of tools that enhance lesson presentation through interactive media.

Teachers visit their students and home tutors throughout the year as required. Students also spend time at school in Port Hedland with school personnel. A range of camps and get-togethers during the year enhance educational and social interaction opportunities with their peers, staff and other families. Port Hedland School of the Air also engages with other Schools of the Air on intrastate and interstate excursions.

The school is supported by a school council, which consists of five parent and four staff representatives, including the Principal. This group meets three times a year and plays a key role in providing the school community with input into school planning and decisions. Our Parents and Citizens Association also provides strong support to the school and its students.

Staff work within a modern building with state of the art electronic resources. Teachers' workstations have email and internet access and are linked through a sophisticated network to support the planning, reporting and communication processes of the school.

The enrolment intake area comprises the long established 'Old Quinns' development which provides a diverse population range and is characterised by a relatively low transient rate. We have the optimal enrolment of just under 400 children but our catchment is diminishing it its capacity. The majority of our children come from out of our catchment.

Staff are welcoming, personable professionals, who in the large majority of cases, are experienced and long serving in this local school community.

Quinns Rocks Primary School is committed to providing a holistic, inclusive and relevant education for each child that will provide a strong foundation for future learning in a rapidly changing and diverse society. School programs are underpinned by a set of values complementary to the school and local community. Focus on developmental learning in the key learning areas of Literacy and Numeracy is strengthened by a collaborative approach by staff across all phases of learning. Whole of school programs contribute to the successes in student achievement. An integrated Visual arts program with specialist teacher in a purpose built facility provides that creative opportunity. The language of choice commencing with Year three in 2018, is French. A specialist Science program incorporating Primary Investigations covers National curriculum requirements. The Music program provides opportunities for instrument tuition through the School of Instrumental Music and participation in choral activities and musical productions. A spirited physical education program complements the community based sporting groups and encourages participation through a range of intra-school and inter-school activities. Dance is offered to Junior children and this program is warmly received as is our specialist Dance Teacher.Sustainability is evident in the school( Living Laboratory) with an established nursery, class vegetable gardens, chickens and the weekly cooking program incorporating the harvested products.

Every Tuesday morning, we conduct a Family Links program for new parents with their pre-pre school children. A recently completed new Early Childhood teaching block has eliminated all temporary student accommodation.

Our pastoral care program is highlighted by well established processes in student management with a consistency in both understanding and application. Building resilience is the focus that will build a more caring child, a more influential parent and more effective staff. Students are offered a variety of leadership opportunities through the student council, faction leaders, peer mediation program and in technical support.Senior children attend a leadership seminar along with their peers from across the metro area each year. Our year six cohort participate in an excursion to Sydney and Canberra in September.
each year.

The school/community partnership has been well established over the thirty plus years of history and continues to provide a strong connectivity and ownership. An emerging School Board has been instrumental in compiling the last two Business Plans for the school.

The school hosts a Before and After School Care program on site.

Stability, continuity, consistency and experience are the effective characteristics in our school motto - 'Working and Sharing Together.'

Rangeway Primary School,5388,"

Rangeway Primary School is located within the Mid-West Education District in the City of Geraldton. In 2017 Rangeway PS operated with 2 Kindergarten classes, 2 Pre-Primary classes and 16 Year 1 to 6 classes, with an enrolment of 404 at the start of the year.

The school's student population is comprised of 67% Indigenous students and 2% of Malay heritage, with the remaining a mix of other nationalities. Our student transiency rate sits at approximately 57%.

The Rangeway community is considered to be socio-economically disadvantaged as identified through an ICSEA of 729, which places it in the tenth decile of social disadvantage.

We have a 'Child and Parent Centre - Rangeway' located on site since 2015, supporting children 0 - 8 years old and families throughout the wider Geraldton community. We utilise many support programs and agencies through the centre including;
* Child Health Nurse,
* Allied Health Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy,
* Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters (HIPPY Program)
* Kindy Readiness and Orientation Programs
* Strong Self Strong Spirit resilience building program
* Triple P - Positive Parenting Program

The school promotes social development through the 'Zones of Regulation' program in Junior Primary and the 'Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies' (PAThS) program used in middle and upper primary.

The school has established and maintained very strong interagency partnerships to support students at risk. We have both a School Chaplain and a School Psychologist on site to support students at risk. We also link with Desert Blue Connect and Helping Minds, amongst other agencies, to access support in the pastoral care/emotional well-being realm for our students.

The school prioritises:
* Literacy and Numeracy achievement - through a Tiered Response to Intervention to cater for all academic abilities. We have several tiered responses to support learning for all students, including Direct Instruction, Synthetic Phonics and a Dyslexia Support Program. We also provide an Extension Program in Years 3-6 to cater for our high achieving students. Specialist and Support staff are utilised in classrooms during Literacy/Numeracy Blocks to support student achievement.
* Early Childhood Education - Utilising the National Quality Standards and Early Years Framework we link with other agencies, including the Child and Parent Centre and Allied Health, to provide a wraparound service to support all developmental facets of Early Childhood Education.
* Aboriginal Education - Linking with community organisations wherever possible, like Bundiyarra Aboriginal Community Corporation, we continually strengthen our focus in Aboriginal education and achievement through the Aboriginal Cultural Standards framework. We are committed to closing the gap by having an early intervention support approach, building community partnerships where possible, strengthening home/school relationships, providing Wajarri as our Language Area, involvement in the YuMi Deadly Maths initiative, and utilising Aboriginal Islander Education Officers to provide shoulder to shoulder support for our students.
* Attendance and Well-Being - Our commitment to improve student attendance is evident through whole school rewards and initiatives, provision of emergency lunches and uniforms whenever required, appointment of an Attendance Officer within the school and a continual focus throughout the school to reinforce to both students and parents that Every Day Counts.
'Well-Being' incorporates student engagement, behaviour and social/emotional development. At RPS we encourage a hands-on, co-operative learning focus where all students are actively engaged in their learning while also building their social skills. Our Tiered approach to behaviour incorporates a whole school plan which caters for 85% of the school population, an individualised response with specific programs for another 10% and an intensive support plan with interagency involvement for the final 5%. This, combined with our Zones of Regulation and PAThS programs, provide the solid structures and expectations to allow all students to reach their educational potential.
In 2017 Rangeway PS initiated a Nurture Group programme to support identified Year 3-6 SAER students in regard to their academic and/or social/behavioural development. This program gave intensive support to students and incorporated interagency and community involvement, whilst maintaining a strong focus on social/emotional development.

These priorities, combined with high quality teaching and leadership, encourage and facilitate students to achieve their potential and realise our vision at Rangeway PS of;

'Providing a quality education in a caring and supportive learning environment, enabling all students to become life-long learners who contribute positively to society.'

Our staffing allocation is reviewed annually and is dependent on the nature and severity of students' disabilities. Students have access to speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy provided by Therapy Focus. We currently contract a speech pathologist who assists us in providing appropriate communication strategies for our students.

Locally the school site is referred to as Riverton Primary Campus to reflect the dual nature of the site and the consequent wide range of programs and facilities offered. We believe we offer the 'best of both worlds' to students with disabilities. While they are taught individualised functional academics in small groups, they integrate with their peers for music, phys ed. sport, excursions and assemblies. The junior class teacher works colloaboratively with the year 1 teacher in a variety of subjects, including Big Book reading, art, news and drama. The students in the middle and senior classes (4-7) use the community as an extension of their classroom - learning real life skills such as transport training, shopping, showering, dressing and cooking. Individual students in the middle and senior class access the mainstream for art, music and physical education. They also share the same play areas at recess and lunch. Students with Special Needs usually require support in the development of their social skills. These skills they practice with their peers at break times.Our programs emphasise life skills while developing independent work habits.


Our School Vision - To ensure that our students develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes relevant to individual needs, thereby enabling them to fulfill their potential and contribute to the development of our society.

Roebourne District High School,4189,"



Settled in 1866, Roebourne is WA's oldest surviving town north of Geraldton. In fact it is the oldest settlement between Geraldton and Darwin and has an estimated population of 1,200 people. Roebourne is located near the Pilbara coast, approximately 1500 km north of Perth and 40 kilometres east of Karratha. Most of the staff live in Karratha and commute each day out to Roebourne.

The weather in the area is sub-tropical. There is the wet season [summer] characterised by hot days and occasional heavy rainfall, whereas the dry season [winter] is much cooler with little to no rainfall. The average maximum temperature for the year is 34.3 degrees centigrade, with dry season temperatures consistently over 35 degrees centigrade and the average minimum 20.7 degrees centigrade. Rainfall averages approximately 290mm a year.

Education in the town has a long and rich history, with the first formal schooling starting in 1874. In 1892 a masonry building, in Hampton St, replaced the former timber framed building of 1884. The school moved onto the present site in 1961.

The school caters to students from Kindergarten to Year 12, with approximately 99% of its cohort being Aboriginal. Although there are a number of language groups in Roebourne, the students generally come from three main language groups - the Ngarluma people who are the traditional owners of the land, the Yindjibarndi people and the Banyjima people. The students speak a range of languages as well as Aboriginal English. Teachers are expected to adopt and to use ESL strategies for most of the students throughout the school.

While the major emphasis continues to be Literacy and Numeracy for all students, secondary students focus on employment preparation. Students have opportunities to participate in Vocational Education and Training programs which work closely with local organisations, businesses and the mining industry.

Aboriginal and Islander Education Officers (AIEO's) have significant roles in the school and are seen as teachers-in-training for most activities. They provide essential links to the community and provide teachers with cultural expertise and knowledge. An understanding, appreciation and respect for Aboriginal culture is paramount to the success of any teaching programme within the school.

The school is supported by the community and through Aboriginal Corporations and agencies, as well as by mining and other companies, Government Departments and non government organisations. The community has a strong arts base and this has influenced the school community in developing a strategic plan, with a movement to Arts based programs so as to engage a wider range of students.

Students arrive by bus from suburbs throughout the South Metropolitan Region. Some have experienced limited formal schooling and will stay for up to two years. Others will stay for shorter periods as they develop English language and cultural understandings before returning to their local schools. IEC students are highly valued and contribute significantly to enriching our school community.

Scaddan Primary School is a caring and positive environment. High quality explicit teaching enables our children to become 21st century problem solvers who actively contribute to the local and global community. We nurture pride, excellence and respect to grow independent and confident children who value themselves and others. We are a unique and proud community built on positive relationships.

Scaddan Primary School, located 50kms from Esperance, caters for children from Kindergarten to Year 6. The student population is drawn from the Scaddan and Grass Patch farming communities. Students come from surrounding farms and travel some distance on one of two buses servicing the school.

We currently offer two classes - a Kindergarten to Year 2 class, and a Year 3 to 6 class, both of which are supported by part-time education assistants and a teaching principal.This structure and our smaller class sizes allow us to maximise educational outcomes for our students. Research has highlighted the benefit for children when learning in a multi-age classroom. Children are provided with a more holistic, child-responsive curriculum that considers the understandings, capabilities and dispositions of each child. The younger children benefit from the positive modelling of older children, often aspiring to their levels of capability. At the same time, older children rise to the expectations of the younger children, being responsible and having the opportunity to lend and use their expertise (Multi-Age Learning and Teaching, 2006, Queensland Government).

Through integrating different learning styles we grow independent, confident and self-directed learners. We acknowledge that not all students learn at the same rate. Our school has a strong focus on literacy and numeracy, using high quality explicit teaching to ensure our students become competent in these essential skills. Students learn to think critically, value themselves, others and actively contribute to the local and global community.

We are proud of our diverse range of programs that engage all learners at our school. These range from our core literacy and numeracy programs to dedicated information and communications technology time. Students also enjoy taking part in hands on learning experiences with the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program.

Our school has a passionate and active P&C and School Council who work closely with the school to ensure children are provided with the best educational opportunities.

Our school is a dynamic, inclusive learning community that is based on mutual respect, personal responsibility, honesty and integrity. High expectations are the core of everything we do with a focus on achieving our personal best.

School Of Special Educational Needs: Behaviour And Engagement,6200,"

The School of Special Educational Needs: Behaviour and Engagement (SSEN:BE) provides educational support and services for students with extreme, complex and challenging behaviours. Support is available across the public school system

Intensive support to students and consultative support to schools is delivered through 13 engagement centres and the Midland Learning Academy (the Academy). The services of the engagement centres and the Academy are coordinated through SSEN:BE, which provides the administrative structure that oversees and manages these services as a statewide model of support for schools, teachers and students.

Engagement Centres coordinate the K-12 provision of the following three services:
- Professional learning to improve student engagement and behaviour.
- Consultative support for schools needing additional advice on dealing with challenging behaviour and managing severely disengaged students and/or those with very complex needs.
- Intensive support for individual students exhibiting the most extreme, challenging and complex needs.

The Academy is a small school model designed for highly disengaged students who are no longer participating in mainstream schooling and are unlikely to reengage with mainstream schooling even with the additional support and services provided by engagement centres.

The Academy is more informal than a standard school with students having individualised learning programs based on their interests and aspirations. Teachers guide students through their program with the support of family and mentors. Learning occurs on site and also involves workplace and community engagement related to each student's learning goals.

Seaforth Primary School,5554,"

Welcome to Seaforth Primary School.

Our Vision is 'Supporting the Journey'. This statement is in fact the guiding principle of our school. Everything we do in our school relates that one statement. All new teaching and learning programs introduced into our school must contribute to supporting students to be successful in all aspects of schooling.

Seaforth Primary School is a relatively small school situated in the suburb of Gosnells. Student numbers hover around 300 which makes for a more personalised approach. The school is unusually placed as the front of the school is well and truly embedded in suburbia but the back is surrounded by paddocks with dairy cows occasionally wandering past.

The teaching areas are of a cluster design which allows classes to collaborate on learning tasks. There is a computer lab which has up to date equipment. We have computer ratio of 1 for every 6 students. The school has a large well stocked library. The library is used for many activities including a lunch time retreat and a Breakfast Reading program. Three Playground climbing structures dot the school and are highly utilised by students. A large undercover area is used for assemblies and boasts games like 4 square and over size chess.

The school has implemented a whole school teaching and learning pedagogy. This is based around the Language Literacy program developed by Dr Ann Morrice. In essence every lesson, regardless of the subject area, is a language lesson. Teaching is in cycles in which language is explicitly taught, supported through modelling and practiced. Seaforth also has a physical education program which centres on offering students a range of sporting types. The program is designed to expose students to sport they may not have considered, plus it helps with improving physical activity.

Student behaviour at our school is a focus. Our main theme is that students are here to learn and nothing should impede on this. The school has developed a new framework for managing student behaviour. The school has levels of good standing. Students who have good standing are rewarded by class teachers and clusters. The rewards vary and are tailored to the age of the students. Students are encouraged to always have good standing. Students outside this are given consequences that match the negative behaviour. It's all about personal responsibility. Major student negative behaviour is not a real issue at Seaforth.

In all Seaforth Primary School is great place to be. Visitors to our school comment on the positive atmosphere and the likeability of our students. This is something we are extremely proud of.

Working closely with our neighbouring schools as part of the recently formed Comet Bay Professional Learning Community (CBPLC). The CBPLC continuously seeks out and shares learning and then acts on that learning. The goal of the CBPLC is to enhance our effectiveness as professionals so that students from all our schools benefit.

We provide a caring environment where individuality is recognised and valued; students develop self discipline respect and concern for others; self esteem self reliance and responsibility are fostered; a sense of belonging and pride is engendered; and they develop an ability to work cooperatively with others whilst communicating in a sociably acceptable manner.

Our school provides a learning environment where students are committed to excellence; diversity is recognised and catered for; full potential is achieved; they are encouraged and assisted to accept responsibility for their own learning; they make a positive contribution to the school and wider community; they develop respect for the rights of others; and learning is seen as part of a life-long process.

We aim to establish and maintain links between staff parents and members of the broader community through the free flow of communication; a commitment to seek out and encourage those who can enrich the school programmes; and the provision of opportunities for involvement and initiative in shared decision making.

Serpentine Primary School,5415,"

At Serpentine Primary School we acknowledge our history and tradition and seek to balance this with a focus into the future, embracing innovation, current educational research, and teaching and learning practices.

Our commitment is to ensure that children attending Serpentine Primary School are treated to all benefits that a rural school has to offer while still receiving the highest quality education. The belief that all children can be high achievers and that every child matters every day is fundamental to our approach.

A clear moral purpose, explicit teaching strategies and shared leadership drive our approach to teaching and learning. It is what we do every minute, every hour of every day that makes the difference. When we get the teaching right, student success is guaranteed and the structures we have in place hold teachers accountable to working towards ensuring this takes place.

Our committed teaching staff provide numerous learning opportunities for children, whilst developing them socially, physically, academically and emotionally to reach their goals. Our teachers use an explicit teaching model to teach the fundamentals in numeracy and literacy and hold themselves accountable to ensure that all students develop strong basic skills, which set them up for success in later years.

A wide range of specialist programs (physical education, the arts and science) offer children a full curriculum, inclusive of their individual abilities and interests. We also have an experienced and supportive student services team, led by our learning support coordinator, to enhance our commitment to ensure the specific learning needs of children are met and to aid in the development of safe and supportive learning environments for all students.

Our schools offer students a range of diverse extracurricular activities. External and in-school extension programs are available for talented and gifted students in physical education, science and art. There is also a running club, morning dance program, school choir and student enterprise program for older students. A strong technology program exists to ensure students and staff have access to information and communication that enhances learning. Instrumental courses are offered on site through the Schools Instrumental Music Program.

Serpentine Primary School aims to develop the skills, knowledge and understandings that will assist each child to become successful lifelong learners and contributors to the community. With this is mind Serpentine Primary School began its journey into Positive Behaviour Support in 2018 to establish a school climate in which appropriate behaviour is the norm and where our students are rewarded and acknowledged for making positive behavioural choices.

It is our shared belief we have a responsibility to teach and learn alongside our students within a moral and ethical framework and that education should be enjoyable for every child. We believe that the educational process is best served when the school, the child, the teacher and the parent work together in a positive way to support learning and a real family atmosphere can be found within our grounds. Parents are welcome to take an active role within the school and opportunities are available to be involved in the school through the P&C, special classroom programs and a variety of other school activities.

Our mission is to maximise educational opportunities for children and teach them the self-discipline that will inform their lives and give them choices.

Students and their families can choose any access to the curriculum that is a 'Best Fit' for them. Some students use both Educational Interpreters and Notetakers particularly if working in an ATAR stream. All students also benefit from the Captioning done at our Captioning Centre as all visual texts must be captioned.

The Shenton College Deaf Education Centre Council has very experienced representatives and contributes to the smooth operations of the Centre. Shenton College Deaf Education Centre's ultimate aim is to connect the students through the school community, to a very successful future.

School Ethos

Our aim is to work closely with our community to provide an outstanding educational experience for students.

Purpose- The main function of an effective school is teaching and learning. Students strive to succeed. Students are encouraged to take risks, to accept challenge and to learn from mistakes. School staff support students by providing an orderly, safe and encouraging environment. They put social and emotional support structures in place to ensure all students are confident and happy.

Culture - The school culture is based around the concept of a 'village'. It is defined by the following characteristics
- All students, parents and staff know each other well
- Each person shows genuine concern for the care and welfare of others
- We care for our school and our physical environment.
- We care for members of the wider community eg the elderly
- We participate in community building activities eg Clean Up Australia
- Teachers and parents model good behaviour and good citizenship

We believe that children learn best when
- There is a partnership between the school and the home
- Individual needs and differences are recognised and supported
- Teaching practices encourage students to take responsibility for their own learning
- A strong literacy and numeracy base is established for each child
- They are happy, well nourished, rested and physically fit
- Positive values are implicit in the schol environment

Students are encouraged to participate in a range of 'extra curricula' activities eg interschool sporting competitions, instrumental music (brass, guitar and keyboard) and choir performances.

The school, in conjunction with its parent body has developed a behaviour management policy that is implemented consistently. The staff of South Halls Head PS believe that the teaching of values is extremely important and that this is best done through modelling and an integrated approach so that all lessons involve an element of values teaching. As a result we have few incidents of inappropriate behaviour.

The staff of the school have, in the main, been 'merit selected'. This means that teachers are very capable and have chosen to be a part of the South Halls Head PS team.

Through close monitoring of the progress of every child and with small class sizes we are able to tailor our teaching plans around the needs of individual students. We pride ourselves in consistently preparing our students for high school with the academic and social skills they need to thrive.

Our teaching staff are committed to continual self-improvement and engage in high quality, relevant, professional learning, ensuring they are able to meet the needs of their students.

Music plays an important role in our school with every child from Year 3 having the opportunity to learn a brass instrument or an instrument to accompany the school band (drums, keyboard or percussion). All Year 3 to 6 students also learn ukulele with a half hour lesson every week. Our school chaplain leads our vocal music program.

Our facilities are modern and spacious with up-to-date technology and almost a one-to-one ratio of computers to students. We have a modern, purpose-built library that is very well stocked with a great collection of books from a range of genres. Within the library, we are developing a dedicated space for STEM. Our extensive grounds allow our students to enjoy a variety of outdoor activities including mountain bike riding and orienteering along with the more traditional sports of cricket, AFL, netball, basketball and athletics.

Southwell Primary School in Hamilton Hill is a fun and safe, supportive and friendly place to learn. Our vision is to give every child, every chance, every day.

We love our multicultural diversity and welcome everyone with the perspective of 'what can we learn from you'.

We have respect for one another; we make learning fun and are dedicated to getting better at everything we do. Everyone loves learning at Southwell. Staff actively work toward every child making friends and being part of our Southwell family.

Our community takes pride in the knowledge that we give every student in our care the very best possible education in order to prepare them for life beyond school. Our 'Learning Community' of staff, students and family are involved in all aspects of school life and identify with our vision to promote student education and well-being.

Our school community has expressed that the most important skills are literacy, numeracy and engagement with learning. Literacy and numeracy are explicitly taught from Kindergarten to Year 6 through coordinated programs across all learning areas.

Southwell students build memories of being happy, accepted and valued while building friendships that last beyond the school gate. Our staff view this as essential to our teaching and learning programs. Students are encouraged to develop a keen sense of social justice, a moral conscience and be an articulate voice for a better society. In essence, we educate the whole child of today to become a successful adult of tomorrow.

A high number of people who attended Southwell themselves now send their children and in some cases grandchildren to Southwell Primary School. This level of connection with families creates a strong sense of connection across the generations.

We believe children need to master these skills to the best of their ability to develop fully as an individual, to live a satisfying and rewarding life and to fully participate in our society.

Takari Primary School,5507,"

Welcome to Takari Primary school where we firmly believe that students can reach their full educational potential only when they are happy, healthy and safe. This is best achieved through the collaborative practices of all involved in the process - the student, the staff of the school and the family.

Takari is the Aboriginal meaning for 'Tomorrow'. Established in 1969, Takari Primary School is located in the northern suburbs of Perth in the Balcatta area. We cater for students from Kindergarten to Year 6. With an approximate population of 160 students, we are a small school where every child is known and valued. The Takari staff is committed to providing a supportive, safe and nurturing environment to all our students.

Our school prides itself on being culturally diverse. Our students are encouraged to celebrate differences and welcome others into the school community. We have a strong focus on the development of students' numeracy and literacy skills and have developed learning programs that use whole school strategies and planning processes that address individual student needs, provide small group learning experiences and explicit whole class instruction.

We have introduced the Primary Connections Science program throughout the school. Aligned to the Australian Curriculum, Primary Connections focuses on developing students' knowledge, skills, understanding and capacities in both science and literacy through working cooperatively in teams through a process of engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate.

Our school continues to make significant progress in developing teacher and student skills with a range of technology. A focus on the integration of technology will include the installation of interactive whiteboards in every classroom this year. Our computer lab is now equipped with 30 new computers and all teaching blocks are networked with internet access.

Takari also has experienced specialist teachers in music, physical education and Italian.

The Australian Government's Building Education Revolution initiative has seen the completion of two new facilities for the school. Completed in the 2011 school year, we now have a spacious air conditioned library and an enclosed undercover area which accommodates the whole school for assemblies and also provides a safe and well equipped play area for the children. Within the undercover area is our new school canteen which operates three days a week.

Our School Council meets regularly to monitor the school's financial position and actively contribute to the preparation and ratification of policy documents and management plans.

Our P&C, a small but dedicated group of volunteers, have undertaken many fundraising events to help improve the school's resources. Opportunities exist for parents to become more involved in all areas of the P&C for 2018 and all volunteers will be most warmly welcomed.

We look forward to your involvement and participation, sharing with the school and your child, the excitement of learning.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

Tjuntjuntjara Remote Community School,5814,"



Tjuntjuntjara Remote Community School is located in the Tjuntjuntjara Community, home of the Spinifex people. The Tjuntjuntjara Community is in the Great Victoria Desert close to the border with South Australia, north of the Nullarbor Plain and 630 kilometres north-east of Kalgoorlie. It is considered to be one of the most remote communities in Australia. The community was established in 1988 when people moved from Coonana to Tjuntjuntjara to follow a traditional lifestyle and maintain cultural identity & values.

A school was independently established by the community and run in a shed until 1988 when it was annexed to Yintarri RCS in Coonana by the Department of Education. At the beginning of 2008 Tjuntjuntjara RCS officially became a new school. The school works hard to foster an environment where we show leadership in supporting the community's goal of improving relevant and meaningful educational outcomes for the children of Tjuntjuntjara.

Currently Tjuntjuntjara has a population of approximately 160 - 200 residents, however this can swell or decline depending on Western Desert cultural cycles. It is an alcohol-free community where substance abuse and petrol sniffing is rare and there is little need for policing in the community. It is generally a quiet place where people feel safe. The main language spoken in Tjuntjuntjara is Pitjantjatjara followed by English.

OUR VISION is to be recognized as a centre of educational excellence, playing a key role in closing the gap in Indigenous life outcomes and working in partnership with the local community to support and maintain local knowledge and culture.

Maintaining traditional culture whilst preparing their children for a rapidly changing world is a key community priority and we work closely with the Tjuntjuntjara community to address this. We offer a broad curriculum with a strong focus on learning English as a second language through the use of Aboriginal Literacy Strategies. Our students are a delight to teach as they are characterised by a passionate desire to learn, a love of books, enthusiasm, generosity, cultural pride and a sense of community.

We experience strong community support and involvement, with elders acting as valued role models and mentors for our students. We value and celebrate the work of the artists of the Spinifex Arts Project, which was established in 1997 as part of the Native Title documentation process, when their paintings were used to document the entire Spinifex area showing claimants birthplaces and important stories that traverse and give form to the area. These paintings were formally included in the preamble to the Native Title agreement ratified before the Federal Court in November 2000. Our music program is enhanced by the involvement of community members who have joined our students to form Tjuntjuntjara Band using modern acoustic equipment.

Useless Loop Primary School,5516,"

Useless Loop Primary School is unique in that it is situated in a small mining town which is closed to the general public. All students are children of employees creating a situation where transiency is a norm due to employment conditions and mining requirements changing. At the same time there is a sense of stability as all parents are fully engaged in employment and generally remain in the community for a few years. Student numbers range between 18-29.

Useless Loop is a very scenic, yet isolated community located approximately 850 km from Perth, and 450 km from Geraldton. The nearest town is Denham, which is 220 km by road, but 10 minutes across the water by plane. The town has a population of approximately 139 people including 42 children. Useless Loop is part of the Shark Bay Salt Joint Venture mining lease and as a result there is restricted access to the community by visitors. Shark Bay Salt supplies services and utilities in the town, with the nearest government agencies based in Carnarvon or Geraldton. The school was established in 1969 as a result of the Shark Bay Salt Joint Venture vision of establishing a community by attracting potential employees and their families.

Useless Loop Primary School caters for students from Kindergarten through to Year 6. The school is part of the Mid West Education District and is serviced by the Regional Education Office in Geraldton. Useless Loop forms part of the Coral Coast Network which includes Exmouth, Carnarvon, Gascoyne Junction and Burringurrah. It is part of the Remote Teaching Service which provides financial and leave incentives to encourage staff to remain in the school for up to four years at a time supporting continuity of learning programs.

Low student numbers allows for an individualised approach to learning and promoting a whole school philosophy of Success For All Students. This is addressed using a targeted approach to teaching based on a strong regime of standardised assessments enabling staff to correctly identify where each child would be placed in a larger school. Teachers regularly connect with other schools through professional learning opportunities and school visits. Whole school planning ensures that students are provided with work at their current year level, while engaging with students in multi-aged settings provides for remediation and enrichment.

There is a culture of high standards and expectations with all teachers regularly reflecting practice using the AITSL Professional Standards in their performance management, reporting to parents, parent meetings and informal conversations.

Student and staff health and wellbeing is addressed through a culture of respect and responsibility providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone. Parents strongly support the school in ensuring positive student behaviour and this is heavily reinforced in the community where there is a culture of safety first.

Useless Loop Primary School enjoys a sense of community through a very active Parents and Citizens Association (P&C) which meets at least once per term to discuss innovative ideas to actively engage students and raise funds for the school. They regularly assist the school with the purchase of resources, environmental improvements, working bees and student engagement. The School Council provide a strong leadership and direction by linking the community to the school and overseeing the general direction of school management.

The one line budget has generated opportunity for the school to manage finances differently, with a focus on providing effective teacher allocation regardless of student numbers. There are two classrooms, Early Childhood (K-2) and Senior (3-6). Staffing includes a Principal, two teachers, Manager Corporate Services (finance), library officer, early years education assistant and cleaner. Staff have good access to professional development opportunities outside the school to validate teaching practices.

Walpole Primary School,5449,"



Walpole Primary School epitomises the best that small, local schools offer. Our teachers are very experienced, continually striving to provide students with a state of the art education. Our broad and deep curriculum allows students to extend and build on their knowledge in a safe and caring learning environment. Our classroom sizes are kept small, allowing teachers to provide individualised attention to students and differentiation to the curriculum.

Our school's unique community-based program - UR Walpole - is an annual whole-school cross-curricular program exploring global issues within a local context (making learning relevant to students). Past topics include The Billion Year Journey of the World and The Power of Flowers. Our teachers link the program with the West Australian Curriculum and local issues, with local businesses and community members invited to share in the journey.

We offer specialist programs in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and Music. The STEM program builds on the amazing school and local environment, while every student in Years 3 to 6 volunteers to participate in our school choir, with students regularly performing at town ceremonies and other schools.

Wananami Remote Community School,5714,"




Wananami Remote Community School is located on Mount Barnett Station in the spectacular Kimberley Region of Western Australia, approximately 500kms north of Broome. While Wananami is situated in the community of Kupungarri/Mount Barnett, it services three communities: Imintji, Kupungarri and Dodnun, all found along the iconic Gibb River Road. Students travel from Imintji and Dodnun by bus for up to an hour each way to and from school.

The school provides teaching and learning programs from Kindergarten to Year 6, for predominantly Indigenous students, aged between 4 and 11 years. Most students come from an Aboriginal English or English as a second dialect background and some are familiar with the local Aboriginal language, 'Ngarinyin'. Despite the school's isolated location, many programs and facilities are available to the students including wifi, satellite internet, fibre optic connection between classrooms, a range of digital learning equipment, fully equipped commercial kitchen, an edible garden with adjoining gardening tool shed for students, both a sports shed and an extensive bicycle shed, a new library and picturesque gardens and grounds. There are 3 classrooms including an Early Childhood Centre with a recently refurbished playground area, complete with new shade sails, benches and environmental playground elements.

Our classes are structured as multi-age groups with the Junior Class devoted to K-1, the Middle Class dedicated to Years 2 - 4 and the Senior Class focusing on Years 4 - 6. The dedicated staff consists of a Principal, 3 teachers, a Manager for Corporate Services and a number of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal support staff, including a part time gardener and cleaner.

There are strong links with the 3 communities while staff and students are committed to school progress, increased student performance and addressing the improvement of outcomes, with priorities in literacy, numeracy, health and well-being and attendance.

Wananami RCS enjoys a unique, rugged and beautiful location. It is one of the more remote Kimberley schools and it is quite normal for the school and community to be cut off during the 'wet' due to heavy rains. These same conditions provide a spectacular and challenging environment in which to live and work.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

Some students travel 90 minutes to and from school each day.

Wangkatjungka Remote Community School was opened in 1962 as Christmas Creek School. Parts of the original school still remain and are highly valued by the school and the community. In 1990, the name of the school changed to Wangkatjungka Remote Community School.

Wanneroo Primary School,5454,"

Wanneroo Primary, which was founded in 1899, caters for children from Kindergarten to Year 6. Our families come from a wide geographical area including rural farm lots served by a school bus, town residences and rapidly increasing housing estates to the north, south and west of the town site. In 2005, Wanneroo and Wanneroo Junior Primary amalgamated and a new school was constructed with well appointed facilities complete with air conditioned buildings set in secure and attractive grounds. Additional classrooms have recently been constructed which has allowed the school to extend its early childhood and specialist facilities.

In 2011 Wanneroo Primary was selected to become an Independent Public School (IPS). It has provided the school with the scope for greater autonomy and self-regulation. Importantly it has allowed the school to merit select staff to match the profile of our school and who have the skills and expertise to prepare our students for the 21st century.

The strategic direction of the school for the next three years is outlined in the Wanneroo Primary Business Plan, which has been set by the School Board in conjunction with the staff. Performance improvement targets were reached after an in depth analysis of a range of academic and non-academic data. There is a strong focus on the implementation of whole school initiatives for improvement based on research of contemporary teaching, learning and assessment strategies that are relevant for the context of Wanneroo Primary. The school is currently in the process of implementing the Australian Curriculum across all year levels.

A strength of the school is its professional staff whose collaborative approach to teaching is recognised and valued by the community. The agreed Positive Behaviours or Respect, Integrity, Safety and Engagement RISE for Excellence are embedded across the school community.

The learning environment is enhanced with opportunities to engage in a range of innovative programs including Growth Groups which are conducted in out of school hours with robotics, iPads, sustainability, skipping, choir, science maths, Lego Club and the arts. An innovative program in which students learn Italian through being immersed in the language while participating in visual arts, dance and drama is provided from Year 1 - 6.

For a close and effective working relationship to be developed between the school and home, the involvement of parents at Wanneroo Primary is crucial. Parents are involved in the School Board, the P&C and supporting the learning in classrooms. In 2011, there was a focus on building relationships with the local community including the Wanneroo Business Association who was generous in their financial support of the chaplaincy program.

As an Independent Public School, Wanneroo Primary is well placed to build on its proud heritage and tradition of 'Growing Together'.

The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

THE SCHOOL
Warnbro Primary School is located close to the beach 7 km south of Rockingham. The school is close to rail and freeway links to Perth and Mandurah. The school opened in February 1973 and has operated on the same site since that time. The school having grown to a over 1000 students in the mid to late 1990s now has settled at around 500 students. The trend is for a slowly declining school enrolment as the population of the local community ages.

THE STAFF
Many of the school staff have been at the school for over twenty years with well established relationships with parents and connection with community groups such as local sporting clubs. Others have recently graduated from university bringing new perspectives and fresh ideas to our school. The staff are committed to maintaining a safe, happy and engaging environment for all students and staff in which learning and innovation thrive.

Reflecting trends within the broader social Western Australian community there is a greater level of student transience, cultural diversity and complexity within the school community. Increased numbers of families with both caregivers employed in full-time or part-time work has increased the need for services such as after school activities and breakfast club.

SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

The school has 6 clusters of classrooms.
There is a cluster of 2 Kindergarten classrooms and another of 3 pre-primary classrooms recently built through the Federal Government's Building the Education Revolution (BER) program. Also built as part of the BER is a new Arts, Science, Technology and Extended Services Centre. The Extended Services include Student Services program, School Health services, Speech Pathology, 0-4 Years School Readiness Program, Before and After School Care and after-school activities.

There is a purpose built library, health food canteen that operates each day, covered assembly area, school oval with adjoining basketball/netball courts and cricket practice nets.

A feature of the school grounds is a remnant stand of tall Tuart Trees as well as extensive grass areas and several sets of shaded playground equipment to suit all age groups.

COMMUNITY

The school has from its inception through to today had a very close and supportive relationship with parents and the broader Warnbro community. Many of the families of our school have had two generations graduate from the school. There is a strong sense of connection and belonging within the school community.
The Parents and Citizens Association is highly visible, very pro-active and effective in supporting the school.

The P&C meets on the third Wednesday of each school term. Meetings are used as a forum to discuss educational issues and to organize fundraising to support the educational initiatives within the school. Four committees support the P&C Association: Canteen Committee, Safety House Committee, Grounds Committee and Fundraising Committee

The school community has an inclusive culture in which everyone is welcome and supported in accordance with their needs. Support programs continue to develop and evolve to meet the emerging and ongoing aspirations and challenges before students, parents and staff.

West Coast Language Development Centre,6045,"

The West Coast Language Development Centre is a specialist Education Support facility that also includes the Statewide Speech and Language Service (Outreach) for the North Metropolitan (coastal schools) and the MidWest Educational Regions. The centre is located over four sites.

The West Coast Language Development Centre is a centre of excellence that provides specialist early direct intervention (for students), outreach (for schools and networks) and research and development services in the area of speech, language and associated literacy. The synergism and cohesion among service delivery, teaching and research leads to changes in classroom practice as knowledge increases, 'best practices' are identified, and service needs are recognised within the centre and across mainstream schools.

The West Coast Language Development Centre works at the system, network, individual school, leadership, teacher and student level to provide high quality services in speech, language and associated learning that are based on current best practice evidence. The services build on each other and include:

1.Direct services for students: intensive, early intervention
An early, intensive intervention service for kindergarten to year 1 targets students with identified Specific (Primary) Language Impairment in the metropolitan area. High quality assessment, teaching and learning informs and is informed by research and evidence. Teacher leaders and support staff (including speech pathologists) empower and build the capacity of teachers so that they are results orientated and transformational leaders in their own classroom.

2.Outreach
This service responds to the distinctive needs of public primary schools with a focus on improving speaking, listening and literacy learning for students with language difficulties, difference and disorders. The emphasis is on sustainable capacity building of teacher, school and system to deliver high quality learning opportunities.

3.Research and development
The service conducts and supports the research, development and trialling of evidence based practices for speech, language and associated literacy by establishing collaborative partnerships with schools and universities.

Early intervention, outreach, and research & development services of the West Coast Language Development Centre engage in the provision of high quality, differentiated, flexible, practical support to schools and their communities to develop practices and programs that accelerate and maximise learning outcomes for students with speech, language and associated literacy needs. This is underpinned by the moral imperative that all students can learn, including students with language difficulties, delays, disorders or impairments.

The West Coast Language Centre Services works in partnership with the North East Language Development Centre to provide an integrated cohesive approach to speech and language services in the North Metropolitan Educational Region. North East and West Coast also work with Language Centres from the South Metropolitan Region to provide integrated State-wide Services in Speech and Language across the state.

Western Australian College Of Agriculture - Morawa,4203,"



Western Australian College of Agriculture - Morawa has a catchment area that covers most of the State. Most of our students are from regions north of the metropolitan area, some from as far north as Tom Price, Port Hedland and even Kununurra. The majority of our students have an interest in broad acre cropping and animal husbandry as well as trades related to the automotive and construction industries. Students also matriculate from this college to Curtin University Muresk campus.

The history of Western Australian College of Agriculture - Morawa really began in 1978 when the first residential students sought specialist agricultural education at Morawa. These students lived in the quarters originally occupied by the single men working on the iron ore mine nearby. By day the students worked and studied on the 200 Ha farm which is where most of the buildings now stand.

In 1984, the Education Department declared the farm an Agricultural Wing, and with two further land purchases brought the farms total area to 2875 Ha.

In 1995 permission was granted for a name change to Morawa Agricultural College and with that came the creation of separate college finances and operational procedures.

In 1999 Western Australian College of Agriculture - Morawa was formed through the amalgamation of the five existing agricultural colleges. At the same time, Morawa was validated to act as a Registered Training Organisation for the delivery of Nationally Recognised Certificate courses.

COLLEGE FARM
The majority of our student's learning experiences are linked to a commercial farming operation. The college farm has a total area of 3244 Ha and has a full program of enterprises including sheep, pigs, cattle (including a Gelbvieh Stud), emus and broad acre cropping. As well as various machinery and storage sheds, there is a modern abattoir, cattle feedlot and piggery.

Since 1995, with the closure of the Chapman Research Station, Agriculture WA has used the College farm for ongoing programs of cropping trials and demonstrated crops, with students monitoring results.

In recent years the college has had great success with its 'Gelbvieh' Cattle Stud, with 'Mowag Astill' voted Junior Supreme All Breeds Champion Bull at the 1998 Perth Royal Show. Showing of stud cattle is an annual event with both cows and bulls experiencing success in their individual sections as well as competing in All Breed championships.

RESIDENTIAL HOSTEL
The college also has three full-time and three part-time Residential Supervisors. Other staff includes two full-time cooks and two kitchen-hands as well as cleaners and garden staff.

We also teach a range of other subjects, such as (information communication technology (ICT), languages, art and music incorporating the use of science.

Our children are encouraged and supported to 'have a go' without fear and to feel comfortable challenging themselves. Most of all, our children understand that learning is fun!

Classrooms are well equipped and comfortable with well-designed grounds for the younger child so they can learn and play in a setting that is age appropriate, safe and stimulating.

Ngaanyatjarra Lands School,5899,"

In 2007 the (then) schools dispersed throughout the Ngaanyatjarra Lands were federated into a single institution. They became campuses of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands School operating under the leadership of an Executive Principal. This was done to enable them to develop a strategic framework and to work collaboratively, share resources, and better address the disadvantages that can arise from their geographic isolation. The School now comprises nine campuses spread across the Western Desert of Western Australia and provides for students from kindergarten to Year 12. Although the campuses are separated by large distances they are bound together by the culture of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

The Aboriginal people (Yarnangu) who reside in the communities are part of a single social system that is referred to as the Western Desert Cultural Bloc. The Ngaanyatjarra people maintain a rich cultural heritage that is based on a close connection with the Land. They have a unique culture, based on the tjukurrpa (the Dreaming), which provides the framework for their world view and their relationship to the land and each other. While families in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands share language and culture and in this sense form a single community, it is also the case that there are subtle differences in each of the communities in which our campuses are situated, varying in size and geographical isolation.

The Ngaanyatjarra Lands are situated in the east of Western Australia covering some 250,000 sq. km. (about the size of Victoria) stretching from the tri-state border with South Australia and the Northern Territory. Approximately 2,000 Aboriginal people live in eleven communities that comprise the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. The population of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands includes the first wave of people who came out of the Western Desert in the 1930s and the last wave in the 1960s. The Ngaanyatjarra people have never left their country, nor has their land been annexed or occupied by outsiders. The predominant language spoken is Ngaanyatjarra though in some places people speak Western Desert dialects of Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi.

The Aboriginal people in the Lands still hunt and gather bush tucker in traditional ways. Traditional men's and women's business remains very strong. The Elders teach the young people about the traditional ways of hunting , gathering and cooking bush tucker, but they also work within the community painting, (tjanpi) weaving and making wooden artefacts (purnu). They are very concerned that their young people do not lose their traditional language and culture.
The school is working with the community to support this process. It wants to ensure that students are prepared to live a good life on the Lands, to be future leaders, and to develop the skills and knowledge to live successfully in 'mainstream' Australia if that is what they want to do.

Like many remote Indigenous schools the major challenge is to improve the attendance levels of students. Considerable effort has been put into ensuring a close relationship between the various campuses and their respective communities and on ensuring that students experience a safe, welcoming and stimulating learning environment while at school.
There is a whole school approach to the professional learning of staff with a central focus on supporting staff to address the needs of students whose first language is not English. There is also a focus on developing a common set of strategies, and shared language, to manage students in classrooms and to expand the range of effective classroom practices. This is based on the Department's endorsed programs: Classroom Management Strategies (CMS) and Instructional Strategies (IS)

We used the Big Picture Education approach as a model for our secondary schooling provision. Effectiely, this means we endeavour to tap into individual student interests and aptitudes in a manner that students and their families are engaged in authentic and meaningful learning.

Woodlands Primary School,5482,"

We are a dynamic and vibrant learning community, with a strong reputation for delivering quality education, cultural and pastoral care programs from Kindergarten to Year 6. We have a firm belief in the unique value of each student, and aspire to provide students with opportunities to discover and develop their talents and abilities. This is facilitated through the delivery of a diverse and engaging curriculum, including specialist programs in Science, Music, Visual Arts, Japanese, Physical Education and Sustainability.

In recognition that all students are individuals, we responds to the diverse needs of all students through the provision of programs and interventions that allow all students to engage with the WA Curriculum. Similarly, gifted and talented students in Years 5 and 6 have access to a wide range of extension courses through Primary Extension and Challenge programs (PEAC).Those in the Early Years can access the Early Years Extension program. Students typically display enthusiasm towards the learning program as they develop their social, physical and creative abilities and skills. Students consistently display pride in their own, peers and school achievements and enjoy being a part of the school community.

Our school runs a comprehensive Positive Behaviour Support program, which aims to develop in the students the four school values of Belonging, Respect, Humanity and Possibilities. These four values are represented by four mythical Woodlandian characters. When Humanity, Belonging and Respect are embedded in a child's behaviour, it will open up infinite Possibilities as students embrace the challenges of the future.

Our specialist Science program caters for students from Pre-primary to Year 6 and delivers hands-on-authentic sessions, in a purpose built Science classroom. The inquiry based program provides our students with ways to explore and gain a greater understanding of the world. Science by Doing encourages students' natural curiosity and willingness to explore. It inspires problem solving and questioning about their world.

The Visual Arts program includes the fields of art, craft and design. Students create visual art works that communicate, challenge and express their own and others' ideas. It encourages all students to engage, inspire and enrich their own learning, along with exciting their imagination and reaching their creative and expressive potential.
Participating in our Music program, students will explore singing, theory, percussion, movement, ukulele and recorder appropriate to the year level from Year 1 to Year 6. Our school is at the forefront of integrating digital technology into our music program.

The junior and senior choirs perform at school assemblies and special events, including the WA Government School Music Society Make Music concert at Crown, the Massed Choir Festival, The Children Sing Festival and performances at aged care facilities. Special instrumental programmes provided by the Department of Education's 'Specialist in Instrumental Music' (SIMS) are available in clarinet, trumpet, violin, viola and cello for selected students. An Ensemble Music Specialist conducts a string ensemble class one morning per week.
Woodlands Primary School consistently performs well at interschool athletics, sporting and swimming events. The students' sportsmanship, support of each other and their willingness to try their hardest in a challenging environment consistently demonstrates how students have embedded the four school values into their approach.

With a strong focus on living sustainably, all students are included in lessons on sustainable practises. Each class at the school reuses and recycles paper, puts their fruit and vegetable scraps into a bucket for the three worm farms, tend to our school vegetable garden and orchard and contribute to reducing waste at the school. Our school is a collection point for aluminium cans, batteries, printer cartridges, mobile phones and oral hygiene products.

The School has a strong history of working together closely as a community to provide the best possible learning opportunities for its students. Some of the school's parents attended the school as children. Parents and carers receive regular, relevant information on student progress via Connect. Fortnightly assemblies, the school website and weekly newsletters are utilised to promote student achievement and provide an effective medium for disseminating information. Woodlands Primary School has an active, involved School Board and Parents and Citizens Association. A high percentage of the parent population is engaged in professional occupations.

As a collective team, our dedicated school staff holds a good balance of youth and experience. The staff and administration foster a culture of working collaboratively to maximise learning outcomes. At all times the staff of Woodlands Primary School are concerned with the development and nurturing of the whole child.
The suburb of Woodlands was developed in the late 1950's and early 1960's. The school was opened in February, 1964 with an enrolment of 53 students. Forward planning saw many trees retained at the school site and throughout the suburb, providing the school with a delightfully picturesque and shady environment.

The Woodlands Primary School community strives to provide a world of opportunity for its students through the power of learning.

We are a proud Independent Public School inspired by our ethos of 'one student at a time in a community of learners'.

Our school strives to meet the individual needs of our students and provide support to develop the dimensions of the whole person within a transformative learning and teaching environment.

Yule Brook College is a small by-design middle school, located in Maddington, 20km south-east of the Perth CBD in Maddington. The college specialises in the education of students in Years 7 to 10, using the Big Picture design to provide an individualised learning plan based on each student's interests and passions.

The Advisory class is an integral part of our school structure within the Big Picture design, and students develop a strong bond with their class and teacher. Advisory teachers remain with their student group for four years and maintain regular contact with parents, who are involved in the development of learning plans, and attend an exhibition presented by their child each term to demonstrate their learning.

Students in Years 9 and 10 extend their learning outside the classroom by attending an internship for at least one day a week, where they learn in a workplace environment and complete project work in their area of passion. Students also have access to the 'Makerspace' within the school - a space with tools and materials where they can design, invent, make and learn by doing.

Approximately one third of our students are Aboriginal, and the school has a long history of partnerships with organisations including Clontarf, the Wirrpanda Foundation and Follow the Dream. These organisations share our goal to improve educational outcomes for all young people, and in particular to close the gap between the outcomes for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth.

The school also has a large Filipino population, and around a quarter of students come from families where English is not their first language.

Families are vital partners with teachers in our school. Our school board includes representation from the local community, parents and staff.
